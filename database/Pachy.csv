Elephant numbers seem to have remained relatively stable with the 1976 estimate being 82,628 +/- 17% and the 1981 one being 85,504 +/- 12%. However, the skeleton count increased about 50% with the ratio of dead to live animals rising from 7.8% to 12.3% over the four year period and much of the increase took place close to settled areas.

Poole, Joyce H.; Moss, Cynthia J.	Musth discovered in the African elephant	African Elephant and Rhino Group Newsletter	1983	Articles	1	8	8	A long standing controversy in the field of elephant biology has recently been cleared up with the discovery that musth occurs in the African elephant. A male in musth secretes from the temporal glands, has a continual discharge of urine, becomes very aggressive and in captivity is very difficult to handle. In African elephants, males, females, juveniles and even young calves secret from the temporal glands thus until detailed observation could be carried out it was difficult to ascertain such secretion as a prime indicator of musth. A long term study started at the Amboseli in 1972  has served to show that each bull comes into musth for a period of time during the year. The duration and timing of musth periods is dependent on a complex interaction of environmental and social factors.	MRigby	pachy001.83.008.008.pdf

Douglas-Hamilton, Iain	Back from the brink	African Elephant and Rhino Group Newsletter	1983	Articles	1	13	13	In the 1960's three well ordered national parks, Queen Elizabeth, Murchison and Kidepo, existed in Uganda. They enjoyed firm political support, a sound economic basis, and an ecological problem of too many elephants. The 1971 Idi Amin coup led to the fall of tourism and a ruined economy accompanied by a deterioration of law and order. High government officials and security officers sponsored elephant and rhino poaching in national parks. The 1980/81 aerial survey showed that both species declined markedly and that poaching was still in progress. However, efforts by the local conservationists with support from outside bodies especially UNDP and EEC salvaged the situation. The 1982 count proved that the recovery of elephant population is likely if security continues to be guaranteed.	MRigby	pachy001.83.013.013.pdf

Taylor, Russell D.	Seasonal movement of elephant in and around Matusadona National Park, Kariba	African Elephant and Rhino Group Newsletter	1983	Articles	2	7	9	Matusadona National Park is one of the protected wildlife areas set amidst communal land in northern Sebungwe region of Zimbabwe. It had been apparent for sometime that the elephant population in the Matusadona highlands moved in and out seasonally and was evident from the seasonal distribution data of elephant in the northern Sebungwe, gathered during aerial surveys. The large discrepancy in wet and dry season elephant numbers confirmed that there was a wet and dry season dispersal. The paper presents the process and results of a project carried out in order to better understand the nature of seasonal movements of the elephants in and out of Matusadona for better management options.

In the 1960's the main problem of elephants in East Africa was one of overcrowding within the National Parks. The 1970's registered increased arms importation due to the prevailing wars and then later got into the hands of poachers. In some countries, such as in Uganda and Sudan, some elements of the military were the main poachers.	MRigby	pachy002.83.011.013.pdf
Olivier, Robert C. D.	Mali's elephants suffer in drought	African Elephant and Rhino Group Newsletter	1983	Articles	2	14	15	Mali's elephant population survives in marginal habitats bordering the Sahara. The largest population is found in the Gourma region. Poaching of Gourma elephants used to be of concern, but this is not believed to be a significant threat anymore. At present the extremely limited availability of water poses a major threat and is accountable for the death of many elephants. The elephants which share their range with other domestic animals and man have to compete for the scarce water.  If present conditions persist, the vulnerability of the population to extinction will increase, the paper highlights some strategies which could be taken to remedy this.

Using data from culled elephants, mathematic models have been developed which use tusk measurement to deteremine age and sex. Given the models presented, the lip circumference and total length of the tusk, in combination, can determine sex, and lip circumference or weight can predict age. Sex and age together can be used to construct mortality patterns which give a clear idea of the elephants killed to supply any ivory consignment which has basic tusk dimensions recorded.

Martin, Esmond Bradley	The ivory industry in Botswana	African Elephant and Rhino Group Newsletter	1984	Articles	3	5	7	Botswana's ivory manufacturing industry began in 1975 with Botswana Game Industries (BGI) as the first commercial company. A high percentage of the finished ivory products were exported. The trade led to increased elephant poaching especially in the northern part of the country forcing the animals to seek refuge in sanctuaries. The Chobe National Park and Moremi Wildlife Reserve attracted great numbers which have in turn  caused large scale vegetation destruction. The effects of elephant predation was a concern to many and led to the commencement of a research project in 1983. In the meantime, all elephant hunting was stopped. The article addresses issues that the Department of Wildlife, National Parks and Tourism should take up to reduce poaching and bring to halt the illegal trade in ivory.	MRigby	pachy003.84.005.007.pdf
Bell, R. H. V.	Law enforcement in Malawi conservation: a monitoring system	African Elephant and Rhino Group Newsletter	1984	Articles	3	7	8	Outlines a monitoring system based on the systematic use of patrol reports produced by field staff. The system is intended to quantify patrolling effort, quantify the illegal activity encountered by patrols according to a set of standardized categories, and derive indices of the amount of illegal activity recorded per unit of patrolling effort. Patrol staff is trained to record data in a standard format. In the case of elephant there are 17 record points including the date of  death, method of discovery, cause of death, presence or absence of tusks, age, etc. Data can be used to monitor preformance of patrol activity, to monitor changes in illegal activities, and to assess the impact of illegal activity on the mortality of key species and trade in their products. The value of this procedure as a management tool was evident in the case of elephant poaching in Kasungu NP. The few years prior to 1981 showed an upsurge in elephant poaching, but no enforcement was forthcoming, in 1982 the Park came under new and active leadership which included the monitoring system, a positive enforcement response was immediate.

Jachmann, Hugo; Bell, R. H. V.	Why do elephants destroy woodland?	African Elephant and Rhino Group Newsletter	1984	Articles	3	9	10	The increase in the number of elephants in some of the conservation areas was followed by a decline in woodland density due to a combination of the destruction by elephants and burning by man. The article addresses the issue of whether modification of woodland by elephants is a natural phenomenon that is part of a cyclical relationship existing between elephants and woodland. A major factor contributing to habitat degradation by elephants could be a maladapted feeding strategy associated with the fact that the elephants now occupying much of the drier areas are descendants from animals of the Central African forest belt. The article discusses the various ways elephants utilize trees or parts of trees.	MRigby	pachy003.84.009.010.pdf

Research on the ecology of the forest elephant is of recent development due to its habitat, the tropical rain forest. Methods used in Tai National Park were based on indirect observation. The forest elephant is well adapted to its environment. The forests provide enough food and water all year round, so the elephant is not forced to travel great distances to meet those demands. Due to increased timber harvesting and agriculture land use the primary rain forest is declining on a large scale. The article addresses aspects of the adaptibility of forest elephant this new environment.	MRigby	pachy003.84.015.016.pdf

In almost all the areas, the elephant population is greatly threatened by poaching. In north west Zaire large areas were devoid of elephants that had been killed by Arab poachers armed with automatic weapons. Elsewhere, as in Uganda, a severe decline was witnessed in the seventies, but poaching is being checked by the National Parks' Rehabilitation Programme backed by UNDP and EEC. Botswana is one of the few countries where elephant populations may be stable, as in Zimbabwe this is due to a strong government support for conservation policy.	MRigby	pachy004.84.007.009.pdf

Ruggiero, Richard G.	Central African Republic hit by poachers	Pachyderm	1984	Articles	4	12	13	Until recently the Central African Republic was home to many large tusked elephants, and one of the largest populations of black rhinos. These conditions were favoured by an excellent habitat and little land use pressure by man. The years following independence saw massive inroads into many areas and Sudanese poachers began to enter the CAR to hunt elephants and rhinos with spears and later with firearms. The last year of the reign of President Bokassa saw the formation of a near monopoly of the trade in ivory by the La Couronne's Society with approximately 200 tons of ivory being exported in 1978. With the collapse of the Society, successors to the ivory trade were numerous resulting in a widespread decimation of the species with 150 tons being exported in 1982. The best hope for both elephants and rhinos lies with the management of  Gounda-St. Floris National Park which is being run by a private corporation on a long term contract.

Later counts were made in 1979 along the Rufiji River, and in 1981 in the north-east Selous. All counts used the same method of counting and analysis. The results between 1976 and 1979 in the Rufiji area of 14,417 to 10,081 gave a 30% decrease for elephants and estimates of 571 down to 290  gave a 49% decrease for rhinos. In north-east Selous between 1976 and 1981 the elephants estimate from 29,026 to 22,589 was 22% lower showing a slight decrease but the rhinos decreased drastically from 1173 to 298 which is approximately 75%.

Martin, Esmond Bradley	Malawi's ivory carving industry	Pachyderm	1985	Articles	5	6	11	Reviews Malawi's ivory carving industry which began the 1920's but is based on an long history of trading in the raw product. Both trade and the industry itself increased until the late 1960's and early 1970's when the Office of Forestry and Game took over the trading in ivory. Registered ivory trophy dealers established themselves around the major cities of Lilongwe and Blantyre. The Department of National Park and Wildlife tended to protect the smaller ivory dealers from the richer, larger ones. Ivory carvers did not recieve a salary but were paid for their products. Over the past decade there has been significant movement of ivory into Malawi from the neighbouring countries. Apart from being a means livelihood for many Malawians, ivory carving earns the government a substantial amount of hard currency. The paper gives an estimate of the national elephant population as approximately 2350 located in nine areas, which for the most part are designated parks or reserves including Kasungu, Liwonde, Nyika NPs and Majete, Nkhotakota, and Vwaza Marsh GRs..

An Administrative Guidance to importers has been issued and holds promise for 1985 the abuse of last year cannot be changed. Japan's ivory imports for 1984 were 473 tons second only to the record set in year of 1983 of 475 tons.	MRigby	Pachy005.85.015.016.pdf

Bell, R. H. V.	Elephants and woodland: a reply [letter to the editor]	Pachyderm	1985	Letters	5	17	18	This letter stresses several points relating to elephant-woodland interaction. It lists factors that control the probability that a tree will die or coppice as a result of breakage by elephants. Reasons as to why the effects of coppicing increase the density of available food for elephants are noted. The question of whether elephant behaviour towards trees is adaptive or maladaptive, and the question of culling in relation to elephant-woodland interaction are addressed.

Borner, Markus; Severre, E. L. M.	Rhino and elephant poaching trends in the Selous Game Reserve	Pachyderm	1986	Articles	6	3	4	In 1981 the Selous Game Reserve, the largest in Africa, harboured the largest elephant and black rhino populations on the continent. The elephant population density was calculated to be very similar during 1976 and 1981 surveys. During the seventies, poaching was minimal due to the inaccessibility of the reserve, but construction of Shell Company oil exploration roads beginning in 1981 can be linked with an increased poaching activity in the area. The depressed economic situation of the country coupled with the rising international prices for ivory and rhino horn contributed to poaching. Results of a survey based on interviews with hunters, staff and clients of the Tanzania Wildlife Corporation and Wildlife Divison staff carried out in 1984 are discuss along with  reasons for increased poaching and recommendations to remedy the situation.

Western, David	The pygmy elephant: a myth and a mystery	Pachyderm	1986	Articles	7	4	5	The paper reviews aspects of the long held debate concerning the existence of the pgymy elephant and notes the author's own observations in the Bayanga Forest in southwestern Central African Republic during a survey in early 1986. The author suggests the persistence of the pygmy elephant myth may be the result of two factors: the tusk development of the forest elephant is more rapid than the savannah or bush elephant, and the belief that such a species exists. However, it appears that two races of elephants do exist in much of the forest areas, but that the two are the forest L. cyclotis and the bush L. africana. This sympatry suggests that there is broader zone of overlap between the ecological conditions favoured by each of the races than generally assumed.	MRigby	Pachy007.86.004.005.pdf

Re-establishment of elephant in the Hluhluwe and Umfolozi Game Reserves, Natal, South Africa	Pachyderm	1986	Articles	7	10	11	Prior to European settlement, when entire populations were decimated elephants were widely distributed throughout Natal and Zululand. Elephants are now protected with the proclamation of the Tembe Elephant Reserve. In line with its policy to re-establish species in conservation areas where they have been eradicated, the Natal Parks Board was motivated to place elephants in the Hluhluwe and Umfolozi Game Reserves which area the largest Reserves in the State. The article discusses the potential problems identified during the planning, and how the monitoring of the programme was conducted in terms of observing movement patterns, feeding behaviour and mortality rate. Thus far the programme, which released 26 animals in Hluhluwe and 30 in Umfolozi and maintains that 18 and 20 are now living in the respective areas, is considered a success.

Martin, Esmond Bradley	The ivory carving industry of Zambia	Pachyderm	1986	Articles	7	12	15	Commercial ivory carving in Zambia began in the early 1970's. This was favoured by a relatively strong economy and easy availability of ivory. Legal trading required one to have a trophy dealer's licence which was granted by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). Zambia's period of economic growth was shortlived and with its decline, foreigners bought goods especially ivory carvings which would have value outside the country. The illegal killing of elephants escalated due to a sharp increase in the market price for raw ivory and the ineffectiveness of the anit-poaching units. In an attempt to manage the ivory trade the NPWS established the Zambia Ivory and Trophy Centre. The article cites some changes which the NPWS should initiate in the ivory trade, at a time when the government of Zambia is actively encouraging foreign tourism inclusive of both hunting and viewing animals.

They ask that anyone with measurements forward  them along with data on the known locality (origin) of the skull plus the sex and approximate age.  They note it appears that in Africa the two types africana and cyclotis seem to have quite different measurements (eg cyclotis have shorter, broader rostrum, less mastoid inflation, longer mandibuler symphysis and smaller teeth),  but that a few specimens in the museum in Belgian which were collected in Virunga NP appear to be examples of interbreeding.  The Asian elephant seem to be of two basic groups also: the mainland or Indian (including Sri Lankan) animals and the insular group generally present in the other range states.

In order to improve the monitoring of elephants and ivory off take African countries who are Parties to CITES adopted to set up an ivory export quota system. An important element for the success of the system is for each state to take stock of its elephant/ivory resources and to monitor status and trends. To gain this information the AERSG Secretariat began a project which uses the Global Resources Information Database (GRID) of UNEP to model elephant densities for those parts of the elephant range where information is lacking. A series of questionnaires distributed in 1986 to elicit recent information will be exhaustively reviewed, together with the interim report of the project, at the 1987 meeting of AERSG.

Aspects of elephant dietary requirements and woodland response to elephant damage are discussed. Instability of woodlands in arid eutrophic areas is the outcome between a number of factors, including seed germination, amount of browsing, season during which major browsing take place, regeneration of woody plants after breakage by animals, soil nutrient availability and shade intolerance. The author notes that the so called non-damaging trait of the desert elephants in Namibia may be related to the time of year during which the animals tend to browse in different locations.

Thomsen, Jorgen B.	Recent U. S. imports of certain products from the African elephant	Pachyderm	1988	Articles	10	1	5	In 1978 the African elephant was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Between 1977 and 1983, bills were introduced in the U.S. Congress prohibiting the importation of elephant products. However, some authorities consider that there are some large populations which if properly managed could sustain commercial exploitation. The paper gives sources of information, the volume and pattern of the U.S. import of elephant products and notes the reasons for the increase or decrease in imports regarding amounts and countries that imported and exported raw and worked ivory and elephant skins between 1982 and 1987. The US trade in elephant products is significant with a annual declared import value of $29.4 million between 1984-1986 and an estimated retail value of at least $100 million. Worked ivory constituted the bulk of imports but the US was during the early 1980s the largest importer of elephant skins which were almost exclusively obtained from culling programmes ongoing in southern African countries.

Some preliminary results of the relationship between soils and tree response to elephant damage	Pachyderm	1989	Research and Opinion	11	29	31	Vwaza Marsh Game Reserve (VMGR) in Malawi exhibits a variety of conditions ranging from sandy well-drained sites where soil-water dynamics generally favour plant biomass production to clay poorly drained sites where soil-water dynamics do not favour plant biomass production. This paper examines preliminary data on the relationship between the range of these soil-water conditions in VMGR and how trees respond to elephant damage. Whereas the standard models of elephant-woodland interactions hypothesize that the effect of elephant on woodland is to reduce tree density, and therefore to reduce food availability, this study indicates that elephant-woodland interactions may be more site specific that previously considered.

Martin, Esmond Bradley; Vigne, Lucy	The decline and the fall of India's ivory industry	Pachyderm	1989	Research and Opinion	12	4	21	Although 19th century statistics are incomplete the import of raw African ivory into India increased gradually. The two main ports of Bombay and Surat received an annual average of 150 tonnes each between 1803-1819 while the average between 1820-1857 increased to 234 tonnes. From 1830 to the late 1850s a significant amount of imported ivory was re-exported to Britain and to China. From the 1879s to WWI India was one of the largest import and re-export ivory markets. Between the two World Wars the import declined. Immediately after WWII India a major importer taking an annual average of 246 tonnes from 1944-1947, but by the 1950s this dropped to 115 tons. By 1958 Hong Kong became the largest ivory importer followed by Japan.  Indian official imports of raw ivory average 50 tons in the 1960s. Illegal East African ivory arrived throughout the 1960s and 1970s although some was imported from Hong Kong during the later years. Annual legal imports in the 1980s were just over 13 tonnes according to Indian Customs and about 9.46 according to CITES. Suggests the 7,200 craftsmen in India in 1978, due to both internal and external situations in the industry, had dwindled to 2,000 artisans by 1989.	MRigby	pachy012.89.004.021.pdf

A number of examples of the keystone role of elephants in African ecosystems are cited. The Amboseli example in Kenya illustrates what happens to biological diversity when through time in relationship to a widely varying population of elephants. Various ecological roles of elephants such as agents of seed dispersal, creators of openings or gaps in forest areas are discuss.	MRigby	pachy012.89.042.045.pdf

Spinage, Clive A.	Botswana's problem elephants	Pachyderm	1990	Research and Opinion	13	14	19	Within recorded history the Chobe/Moremi area of northern Botswana has always been favoured by elephants, several quotes from records of early writers including Selous are given. Populations have increased with little disturbance. However, destruction to the  woody vegetation along the Chobe River riparian strip has been noted and unless elephant are reduced, excessive destruction and loss of canopy cover in the region are inevitable. Population estimates include 39,411 in 1980/81, 50,000 in 1985 and 63,500 in 1989. The author discusses the dynamics of the Chobe population and notes the consequences of an uncontrolled growth in elephatn numbers to the habitat could be catastrophic. In the eastern sector of the country two populations occupy areas near the Zimbabwe border. One group marauds agricultural crops in a relatively densely populated area north of Selebi Phikwe, while the other totally 550 to 600 animals in the Tuli Block have come into increasing conflict with surrounding farmland.

Elephants are thought to have moved into the Park and the surrounding Lolkisale Game Controlled Area and Simanjaro Plains as a result of poaching and harassment in other areas. Poaching of the Tarangire populations was severe in the 1970's with a carcass ratio of 32% reported for 1977, but this had decreased to 6.7% by 1988. The study reports on the age and sex structure of the elephant population in the Tarangire ecosystem which as a whole covers approximately 20,500 sq km supporting a population of about 6,110.

The effects of poaching disturbance on elephant behaviour	Pachyderm	1990	Research and Opinion	13	42	44	Despite a favourable habitat and little pressure on land from the low density human population, the number of elephants in the Central African Republic (CAR) has suffered a dramatic decrease over the past ten years. As a result of uncontrolled poaching and little or no government action,  CAR's late 1970's estimated population of 63,000 elephants was reduced to 19,000 by 1989. Extensive poaching has caused changes in the feeding behaviour and diurnal movements as well as migratory patterns of the elephants within the Gounda-St Floris National Park. As more and more older animals are killed the social system of the herds is destroyed.	MRigby	pachy013.90.042.044.pdf

A prerequisite for efficient control would include the ability to discriminate between tusks from legally and illegally exploited populations.

Analysis of mitochondrial DNA suggests that suggests that it would be possible to regulate the ivory trade using DNA markers.	MRigby	pachy013.90.045.046.pdf

Kes	Further notes on pygmy and forest elephants	Pachyderm	1990	Monitor	13	47	48	Notes that the elephant population of Gramba National Park appers to be an inter-grade betweeen the savanna and the forest elephant with some groups showing predominantly forest type characteristics (small size, small round ears, and narrow straight tusks) while others illustrate savanna characterisitics (larger and different body strucuture,  bigger ears and thicker curved tusks. The L a cyclotis type predominates  although the Park is largely long grass and open savanna with surrounding  woodlands dominated by deciduous trees of  Combretum species rather than forest.  The author notes that the Belgian operated Elephant Domestication Centre  tended to capture the cyclotis type as these animals were reputed to be much more tractable. The staff of the centre also noted a  smaller form of elephant which the local people spoke of  and seemed to be found in the dense Raphia or swamp areas. The small size of captured small statured animals with tusks and the fact that some anmals did not grow much larger is noted.	MRigby	pachy013.90.047.048.pdf

Fay, J. Michael; Agnagna, Marcellin	Forest elephant populations in the Central African Republic and Congo	Pachyderm	1991	Articles	14	3	19	Fay's portion focuses on CAR, page 4 to 12, while the remainder focussed on the Congo pages 12 to 19 is written by both authors. The appendix entitled the Nouabale Brief summarizes biodiversity of the area and the programme planning required to conserve the Nouabale area in the Congo and the adjacent Dzanga-Sangha area in CAR. The ivory trade is estimated to have reduced the wild population of the African elephant by half in the past decade. Until recently very little was known of the elephant population in the Congo and there was a dearth of data about the situation within other central African forest areas.  Results from studies on populations in three study sites corresponding to the the main forest blocks found in Central Africa Republic and three survey sites the northern Congo are presented. No elephants were recorded in the Ngoto forest area in southwestern CAR, the extrapolated population for the proposed Dzanga-Sangha Reserve is 3600 while that for the Ndanda region is 2640. Population density rather than population estimates is presented for the northern Congo, the density compares favourably with that of neighbouring countries and in spite of high poaching activity there could be as many as 25,000 elephants in this region.

Forest elephants once populated the whole west and northwest African region and until the end of the 19th Century, elephants could be found in all parts of the West African forest zone. Continued human population growth and resultant land requirements have impinged on the elephant range. By 1985, more than 90% of the tropical forests had been destroyed, the last intact primary rainforest being restricted to the Tai National Park. Results from a 1988/89 survey of mammals which included a population count of 1520 elephants understood to split up into 20 isolated subpopulations with the largest concentration being in the vicinity of Tai National Park are discussed.

The ranches are now being sold for small-scale farming settlement schemes thus the elephants are increasingly coming into conflict with people. The Laikipia Elephant Project was established to find ways to reduce this conflict. An essential step towards their conservation was to gain information on their movements. Both satellite and conventional VHF collars have been used. Thus far satellite tracking, generally used in higher latitudes, has not proved satisfactory. The paper describes technical aspects of the conventional VHF tracking programme and presents some initial results.	MRigby	pachy015.92.034.039.pdf

The actual figure must have been undoubtedly much more than the official one. It is evident that the Congo participated actively in the ivory trade resulting in a dramatic decrease in populations throughout the ranges in the 1980's. The 1989 ban on ivory trade and subsequent collapse of the market has led to a significant decrease in both poaching and ivory trade.

Status of elephants and poaching for ivory in Malawi: a case study in Liwonde and Kasungu National Parks	Pachyderm	1993	Meeting proceedings	16	59	61	The post ivory trade ban period saw a drop in poaching for the commodity in Malawi. In 1991 an assessment of elephant distribution, numbers and mortality was undertaken.  Elephants occupy three recognizable ranges of which two cross international boundaries. Data from Liwonde National Park show that the elephant population has remained stable since 1978. The population in Kasungu has most probably declined due to crop protection shooting and poaching.

Poole, Joyce H.	Kenya's initiatives in elephant fertility regulation and population control techniques	Pachyderm	1993	Meeting proceedings	16	62	65	During the last two decades, Kenya's elephant population was reduced from 170,000 to 24,000 by poaching. As a result of the 1989 ivory trade ban and increased protection efforts by the Kenya Wildlife Service, the illegal killing of elephants has now essentially stopped. The Service is opposed to culling of elephants and is embarking on a programme of research and development to produce humane methods of elephant population control.	MRigby	pachy016.93.062.065.pdf
Tchamba, Martin N.	Number and migration patterns of savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana africana) in northern Cameroon	Pachyderm	1993	Meeting proceedings	16	66	71	The Sudanian region of Cameroon covers about 198,000 sq kms and comprises two major domains; the Sahelian and the Sudanian. The Waza-Logone floodplain, which lies in the sahelian domain, contains about 1100 elephant, one of the largest populations of the this region of west and central Africa.  Waza NP is the core for elephant  migrations in the sahelian region of northern Cameroon. Three subpopulations have been indentified in Waza: one  migrates between the two Parks tending to be in Kalamaloue in the dry season and Waza during the wet season; a second one is resident throughout the year but moves to different habitat areas according to seasons; and, a third uses the southern part of the Park in the dry season and  moves into agricultural areas to the south during the wet season.  Recently an influx of elephants, probably from Chad, brings the number in the Kaele area to over 320. (Tchamba 1995). Populations in Faro, Benoue, Boubandjidah NPs are 60, 540 and 660 giving a total of about 1620 in the sudanian region of northern Cameroon.  Elephant migrations in northern Cameroon are a cause of concern as during them elephants are killed, farms are damaged ,and crops lost.	MRigby	pachy016.93.066.071.pdf

Illegal activities and law enforcement in the Central Luangwa Valley, Zambia, from 1979 to 1992	Pachyderm	1993	Meeting proceedings	16	82	82	Reviews the effectiveness of law enforcement against poaching in the Luangwa Valley during two periods when funds were available. There was a decline, but not a halt in elephant and rhino populations in 1979-1982 when up to 22 effective wildlife scouts were engaged under the Save the Rhino Trust (SRT) funds providing an operating budget of US$15 per sq km. The illegal offtake of elephant was reduced to about 10% during the 1988-1992 period when NORAD funded the LIRDP programme which provided US$65 per sq km which led to an increase to 285 scouts in 1991. Analysis suggests that most wildlife management purposes including the conservation of elephants can be achieved for US$70 per sq km.	MRigby	pachy016.93.081.082.pdf

Long-distance movements of an unprotected population on the Laikipia Plateau, Kenya	Pachyderm	1993	Meeting proceedings	16	86	86	Results from radio tracking 20 elephants over a two year period suggest the approximately 3000 animals presently in the area are comprised of 4 main subpopulations: the Laikipia residents, the itinerant Laikipia elephants which are the main crop raiders, the forest dwellers which move onto the plains after the rain and the long distance migrants which move between Samburu and Laikipia two times a year. The apparent migration, which is probably no more than 20 years old, may have initially been a response to poaching. Now its occurence is associated with land use conflict and water accessibility.

Leader-Williams, Nigel	The cost of conserving elephants	Pachyderm	1993	Articles	17	30	34	African elephants attract a variety of economic values, and to varying degrees in different range states, live both within and outside protected areas. In either situation, elephants may be in conflict with man. As a result range states have to expend funds to protect elephants. This questionnaire based survey found as a general rule in 1981 it was necessary to spend around US$215 per sq km of protected area to prevent the decline of elephants due severe commercial poaching for ivory. In 1989, taking inflation into account, US$340 would be required to maintain the same standard. Given that ensuring the success of law enforcement efforts is probably the most important management objective for future conservation greater emphasis needs to be placed upon this topic.

Milner-Gulland, E. J.; Beddington, John R.	The relative effects of hunting and habitat destruction on elephant population dynamics over time	Pachyderm	1993	Articles	17	75	90	Over the last two hundred years the ecology of Africa has changed substantially. One of the best documented change is the decline of the continental population of the African elephant. Two major factors likely to have contributed to this are: the reductions in the carrying capacity for the species due to habitat change, and the hunting for ivory. The relative importance of habitat loss versus hunting in driving the population decline has been at issue for several years. This paper attempts to tease out the effects of the two factors on the elephant population over the last two centuries, and to discuss the likely effects of each for the future.

Michael	Studying forest elephants by direct observation: preliminary results from the Dzanga clearing, Central African Republic	Pachyderm	1995	Articles	20	45	54	Daylight observations in a bai or forest clearing with a wet sandy soil substratum, from which elephants obtain water by creating waterholes, have provided identification of individuals as well as analysis of group structure and behaviourial aspects of forest elephants. Elephants which are observed from a seven metre high platform at the edge of the clearing have been present in over 99% of the 1800 observation hours. The high calcium and other cation content of the water may be a partially responsible for the high number of animals visiting the clearing, but the clearing itself provides a location for social activity that is not feasible in the forest itself. The number of males and females observed is very similar and large tusked old males make up 7% of the population, however the presence of males is significantly higher during the wet season. Evidence suggests that the migratory population in the Dzanga Sangha-Nouabale Ndoki complex is comprised of males.The low birthrate and the equity between sexes suggest a stable, non poached population.

Evidence for the effectiveness of an oleo-resin capsicum aerosol as a repellent against wild elephants in Zimbabwe	Pachyderm	1995	Articles	20	55	64	Test results from studies with free ranging elephants suggest a Capsicum-based aerosol solution has validity as an elephant repellent over both short (20-30m) and intermediate (20-30m) ranges, and that Capsicum is a short-term repellent. Preliminary results suggest that this chemical may act as a practical elephant deterrent which can be combined with aversive conditioning of problem elephants.	MRigby	pachy020.95.055.064.pdf

Lahm, Sally A.	A nationwide survey of crop-raiding by elephants and other species in Gabon	Pachyderm	1996	Articles	21	69	77	Gabon harbours one of the largest elephant populations in Africa, and since subsistence agriculture is practised near the forest edges crop raiding by elephants as well as other wild animal species is common. A countrywide questionnaire survey ascertained elephant crop raiding occurred in all provinces, but was highest in the three central provinces of Ogooue Maritime, Moyen-Ogooue and Ogooue-Ivindo. Of the 132 cases of animal crop raiding investigated 80% involved elephants only while 11% were attributed to elephants combined with other species. Bananas appear to be the crop most susceptible to damage, elephants tend to break the stem and eat the inner core and young leaves. Maize tended to be trampled rather than eaten. Sweet manioc seemed to be eaten whereas bitter manioc was more often trampled. Estimating the number of animals involved is not easy, the same individuals were implicated in a number of incidents: one elephant was implicated in 36 of 57 incidents. The present deterrent is control shooting, but since the shooting normally occurs well after the incident and the law requires that the elephant be shoot within five kilometres of a village the original culprit(s) may not be taken.

Dudley, Joseph Paine	African elephants in coastal refuges	Pachyderm	1996	Articles	21	78	83	The history and status of relict elephant populations in three sites in coastal regions, Kakum in Ghana, and Addo and Knysna in South Africa, illustrate common elements effecting the survival of elephant populations within human dominated landscapes. Elephants survived within coastal regions of all three situations due to the presence of core habitat within government forest areas, and it was the habitat refuge rather than the protected status that was the key factor. All three sites are currently isolated from contact with other elephant populations and have been for some time. All three were initially protected under forest reserve status by colonial administration and either maintained or upgraded to National Parks by subsequent national governments. The detailed historical data available for Knysna and Addo elephant populations represent a unique opportunity for investigating the genetic consequences of bottlenecks and reintroduction within isolated elephant populations and could be used to assess the likelihood of prior population bottlenecks within such populations as Kakum where the past history is uncertain.

At present three females are present, no bonding took place between the translocated juveniles and the resident elephants (one of the three translocated animals died in 1994). The author notes that the Knysna population may now be considered functionally extinct and he suggests that small, isolated elephant populations be given immediate attention if the continuity of the species is considered at all feasible in a specific area.

Elephants of the Masai Mara, Kenya: seasonal habitat selection and group size patterns	Pachyderm	1996	Articles	22	25	35	Habitat selection and group formation in Masai Mara National Reserve fits the general pattern observed in other African populations. Both sexes preferred habitat types with large quantities of nutritious grasses during the wet season and both tended to select browse vegetation in the dry season. The larger average group size in the wet season were not the result of random aggregations but rather the result of bull joining cow-calf herds for breeding. The formation of larger groups in the wet season, when food is not limited, probably allows elephants to interact, to determine dominance hierachies and to re-establish bonds. During the early 1990s the elephant population in the area stands at about 1,500 animals.	MRigby	pachy022.96.025.035.pdf
Sherry, Brian Y.; Tattersall, Fran H.	The loss of a population of elephants in the Middle Shire Valley, southern Malawi	Pachyderm	1996	Articles	22	36	43	Reviews two surveys of elephant in the Middle Shire Valley, carried out in 1983-1987 and in 1994, corresponding to the periods before and after the population destruction.  The 1983-87 survey estimated the Valley supported about 10% of Malawi's elephants, a population of 200-300 ranged over  1000 sq kms much of which was in the Majete Wildlife Reserve. With the influx of Mozambican refugees poaching escalated. Government action was inadequate and by 1992 reports suggested the elephant population had been eliminated. In 1994 ground and aerial surveys confirmed no elephant remained in the region. Although direct observation was difficult information was amassed through dung counts, spoor, damage to vegetation including that to agricultural crops, and interviews with local people thus the group size, normal range area and even age and sex of the majority of members were often well known. The 1994 survey interviewed wildlife field staff and people of  16 villages and a low level aerial survey picked out carcass locations. Commercial poaching began in late 1986 and continued unabated until 1991. This aspect plus a refugee camp eventually hosting  >60,000 located in the immediate area suggests little chance for any remmant animals.	MRigby	pachy022.96.036.043.pdf

Habitat change is a prime consideration once the elephants are confined within the fence which has been constructed to offset the extreme human/elephant conflict situation. Three options appear to be wait and see what happens, organize to translocate animals or to cull animals.	MRigby	pachy022.96.046.046.pdf
Abe, Eve Lawino	Tusklessness amongst the Queen Elizabeth National Park elephants, Uganda	Pachyderm	1996	Meeting proceedings	22	46	47	Only the abstract and a summary of the presentation and following discussion are published. The level of tusklessness in Queen Elizabeth elephants was examined to try and find out if there had been selective offtake of tusked individuals, and to determine the increase of the level of tusklessness. Previously tusklessness in the population was very rare as exemplified by records such as the fact that only 1 animal out of 2000 shot in 1920 was tuskless. The present study showed 10% of females are tuskless, 9.5% of the females are single-tusked, and 9.5% of the males are tuskless. Two-thirds of the elephant over 40 are tuskless but no young males less than 10 years old are tuskless. There appears to be a strong genetic basis for tusklessness with 21 of the families studied 42.8% were tusked, 28.6% tuskless and 23% being mixed tusked/tuskless. Future work may include biopsy analysis to identify a possible genetic basis.	MRigby	pachy022.96.046.047.pdf

N'Sosso, Dominique	Problematique de gestion de l'elephant d'Afrique dans la Reserve de Faune de Conkouati, au Kouilou (Congo)	Pachyderm	1996	Meeting proceedings	22	50	56	Based on observations made between 1988 and 1995 the author outlines the constraints to the management and conservation of elephant populations in the Conkouati Reserve created in 1980 in the coastal region of southwestern Congo. Exploitation of the forest for timber and other products including bush meat, land needs of subsistance agriculturalists, and the poor economic base of the area plus the lack of authority regarding land use and hunting rights made it very difficult to work in the area or to find out what the elephant population may be at present. Evidence of some remaining populations are present in the form of fresh meat and tusks in the markets. In 1989 24,050 kgs of ivory in the form of sculptures and 16,400 kgs of raw ivory were recorded by the Forestry office in Kouibou. In 1994 the same office recorded 41,240 kgs in sculptures and 64,700 kgs in raw ivory as coming from the Conkouati area.	MRigby	pachy022.96.050.056.pdf

In 1993 a grant provided for a survey of the Boumba-Bek Reserve in south east Cameroon. The elephant population estimated from two dung counts yielded very different numbers, the first estimated 7000- +/-3000 while the second gave only 250+/-100. Obviously a large number of the population are migratory, it is thought they go south to the Nki area which also has in part been made into Reserve, and the plan is to fit some with radio collars to track them and find out the corridors which they use. The human population in the area is very low so conflict as yet is not a problem.	MRigby	pachy022.96.058.058.pdf

Turkalo, Andrea K.	Studying elephants by direct observation in the Dzanga clearing: an update	Pachyderm	1996	Meeting proceedings	22	59	60	The Dzanga clearing in the southwestern forest of the Central African Republic continues to attract large number of forest elephants. Over the five years of observation 2100 individuals have been identified with 855 being seen at least twice.  Observations have provided data of population structure, social organization, birthrate, and behaviour. The number of elephant identified per day, expressed as a percentage of the maximum 30 minute count, continues to increase with the figures for October 1995 through December 1995 calculated to be 82%. New identifications now average one individual per week. Observations of the 45 males in musth suggest that is synchronized, occurring approximately the same time each year for each male seen in musth. From the data thus far musth can be described as a dry season phenomenon.	MRigby	pachy022.96.059.060.pdf

The Endangered Species Act (ESA), the legislation which deals with the importation of sport hunted elephant trophies into the United States and therefore controls the most lucrative foreign market available to African range states who in part depend on such funds to finance their conservation programmes, has been undergoing review since 1994. The review has caused controversy within the United States, but its outcome could impinge on foreign money available to a number of range states, particularly those in Southern Africa, which have no say whatsoever in the review.

Chafota, Jonas; Owen-Smith, R. Norman	Options for the management of elephants in northern Botswana	Pachyderm	1996	Meeting proceedings	22	67	73	Reviews the recent history and status of what can perhaps be considerd the largest population in Africa, the elephant population in northern Botswana which since 1983 has been managed through a policy of non-interference. The population of approximately 70,000 is contained in a range of about 80,000 sq kms which includes 18,247 sq kms of protected areas, Chobe and Nxai Pan NPs and Moremi GR. The elephant distribution during the dry season is restricted by the availability of surface water. Up to 75% of the population may be confined to 10,000 to 12,000 sq kms mostly within 30 km of the permanent water sources of the Kwando-Linyanti and Chobe Rivers. The impact the animals have exerted and continue to exert on their immediate habitat in the dry season has been a source of much concern, but decisions regarding effective management options are yet to made. The problems associated with the high population and alternative management strategies are outlined. It is suggested that a combination of actions should be coinsidered and implemented.

Capital city artisan markets in Africa and their impact of elephants: a case study from the Republic of Congo	Pachyderm	1996	Meeting proceedings	22	76	76	Only the abstract and a short summary of the presentation and following discussion was published. All ivory observed to be sold by four retailers from September 1994 through to September 1995 in Marche Plateau, the largest artisans retail market place selling ivory in the Congo, was recorded noting the artifact sold, the price and the nationality of the purchaser. Much of the ivory was sold to people form neighbouring African states for re-sale followed by tourists from Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A total of 1,178 people bought 683kg of ivory with the North Africans buying the largest average weight per customer while the French constituted the biggest number of clients. There is evidence that the level of ivory sold in the Plateau market has increased significantly over the past three years. There has been an accompanying increase in the level of poaching of elephants in the Congo.	MRigby	pachy022.96.076.076.pdf
Milliken, Tom	Monitoring the ivory trade and ivory stocks in the post-CITES ban period	Pachyderm	1996	Meeting proceedings	22	77	77	Traffic's assessment of the ivory trade in the post CITES ban period has two major objectives: to identify and monitor the accumulation of ivory stocks, and to develop a database of all ivory seizures, the so called Bad Ivory Database System (BIDS). In terms of the first aspect data from 16 countries show a total of 380 but there are still 16 range ranges to check with and since these include the Southern African states a much larger amount will be recorded. About 500 tonnes in Kenya and Zambia have been burnt. West and central Africa have poorly recorded and poorly controlled stocks and much of the ivory accruing to the governments in these states has been sold in local markets. The official statistics regarding trade are no longer available as the trade is now underground thus BIDS largest source is law enforcement records and more thatn 2,700 seizures have been recorded since 1989. Asian-run, African- based processing operations to produce blank name seals may exist in as many as 12 countries whereas prior to the ban two such operations were identified.

Litoroh, Moses W.	Aerial census of the Gash-Setit elephant population of Eritrea and Ethiopia	Pachyderm	1997	Articles	23	12	18	During a total aerial count in southwestern Eritrea and northern Ethiopia between 31 October to 16 November 1996, 8 elephant were observed. Two animals were near Haicota along the Gaxh River and six were along the Tekezze River on the Ethiopian side of the border. The two groups are considered to be one population although there was a good distance between them. These Gash-Setit region animals are thought to be the only remaining elephants in Eritrea. This is significantly lower than expected,and because the survey was done at the end of the wet season when the animals are dispersed it is recommended a dry season count be done in order to determine the status more clearly. No elephants were seen near the Sheraro settlements which have reported crop damage and it is assumed the two bulls observed near Haicota may be responsible. Two old carcasses were seen.

Bita, Bukar Bulama	Current elephant conservation problems in Borno State, Nigeria	Pachyderm	1997	Articles	23	19	23	Two elephant populations are known to exist in Borno State. One occupies the Bama area in southern agricultural region and migrates between Cameroon and Nigeria elephant range, while the other  occupys the Lake Chad Basin and constitutes the migratory populations moving between Chad and Nigeria and  Nigeria and the northern tip of Cameroon.  In the early 1970s estimated elephant population was 8,060, at present it is estimated to be under 200. The decline is attributed to habitat fragmentation, poaching, and uncontrolled problem elephant control, coupled with a lack of political will and funds to manage the remnant populations. Demand for agricultural land has been largely responsible for habitat fragmentation, and resulting land use conflict has been exacerbated by drought and political instability. Since 1988 when 36 elephant carcasses, with all tusks removed, were found along the Lake Chad shoreline few animals have been seen in this area and the migration from Waza NP in Cameroon to Lake Chad has been intermittent. Human-elephant conflict is increasing, elephant are shot indiscriminately due to lack of both adequate funding for animal control and enforcement of conservation.

Ben-Shahar, Raphael	Elephants and woodlands in northern Botswana: how many elephants should be there?	Pachyderm	1997	Articles	23	41	43	Elephants and fire appear to have a pivotal role in the dynamics of certain woodland types in northen Botswana. This study chose mopane to demostrate the effects of elephants on woodlands because much of the elephants range is within mopane woodlands and this species is a principal food. Elephants in this region tend to converge around water sources and reach high densities, particularly towards the end of the dry season. Biomass reduction as opposed to mortality was examined through elephant off-take and growth rates of plants, and mathematical modelling was done to make predictions regarding impact of elephants. In spite of predictions from other areas this study suggests that from an ecological perspective northern Botswana can sustain well beyond the maximum number (60000) set by DWNP in 1991. As there is no substantial evidence to imply elephants will diminish woodlands below a sustainable level. Culling as a means to prevent woodland loss is not at present a plausible argument. The ecological aspect of the 'elephant problem' in northern Botswana is confined to areas of interest to people where elephants seem to have an excessive impact such as Chobe, Khwai and Linyanti River fronts. A management policy based on the ecological balance between elephants and woodlands would best consider habitats dominated by specific woody plant species where managers perceive a desired vegetation composition and structure to be maintained.

Dublin, Holly T.	Chairman's report: African Elephant Specialist Group / Rapport du Presidente: Groupe des specialistes de l'elephant Africain	Pachyderm	1997	Chair Reports	24	1	6	Clarifies the outfall of the two critical decisions made at the 10th Meeting of the Parties to CITES (COP10) affecting African elephants. The first mandated the transfer from Appendix I to II of the elephant populations of Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe. This downlisting signifies a clearer recognition that these countries do not meet the biological criteria for the maintenance of Appendix I. At the same time as downlisting the three populations provision was made for a one off sale of identified ivory stocks of known origin to Japan for 25.3 tonnes from Botswana, 13.8 tonnes from Namibia and 20.0 tonnes from Zimbabwe. Compliance will be judged by the standing committee, no export can take place for 18 months after the transfer to Appendix II (March 1999). The second decision allowed for a one off, non-commerial buyout of markded and registered government stocks in any range state. The decision provided for a 90 day period during which stocks were registered and marked by TRAFFIC, all were to be completed by 1997. Any proceeds from the non-commerical sale of registered stocks must be ploughed back into elephant related conservation projects through established funds dedicated to this purpose. The actual fate of the stocks was not specified, but resale is (at this time) prohibited.	MRigby	pachy024.97.001.006.pdf

Vanleeuwe, Hilde; Gautier-Hion, Annie; Cajani, Simona	Forest clearings and the conservation of elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) in north-east Congo Republic	Pachyderm	1997	Articles	24	46	52	The high population of forest elephant in Odzala NP is related to the diversity of habitat and in particular the large areas of Maranthaceae forest which provide herbaceous foods and the presence of many forest clearing which offer mineral salts. Both the Mananthaceae forest distribution and the location of forest clearing appear to influence forest elephant movements. Besides being important foraging sites for elephants, forest clearing provide excellent conditions for observing forest animals and accordingly are ideal for both tourists and hunters. The frequency and number of elephants visiting clearings such as Maya Nord, a favoured clearing which served as a major observation site as no evidence of poaching activity was associated with it, during the day offer a remarkable opportunity to observe these and other animals. Such forest clearing have both ecological and economic value for ecotourism. Paradoxically such clearings provide situations wherein the same animals may be vulnerable to hunters thus conservation programmes considering the use of such sites must also develop management and community programmes to discourage poaching.

Aerial surveys of northern Botswana's elephants have been taking place since the early 1970s. While it is not possible to use all of the data from the surveys, they provide evidence to suggest that since 1987 the population of elephants in northern Botswana has increased to the present level of about 80,000 animals at a rate of around 6% per annum. Their range, which has expanded south and westward, changes seasonally, but is largely outside protected areas.	MRigby	pachy025.98.014.027.pdf

Chemical immobilization of African elephant in lowland forest, southwestern Cameroon	Pachyderm	1998	Articles	25	32	37	Undertaken in the lowland forest of southwestern Cameroon, as part of a long term investigation of elephant ecology, this study was the first one to immobilize and radio collar free ranging forest elephants. The paper reviews the difficulties encountered in the December 1990-April 1993 study during which six immobilizations (out of 12 reviewed attempts) were completed, however two of the darted animals were dead when located. Etorphine and carfentanil were used as immobilizing agents. Dense vegetation, diverse topography and severe climatic conditions caused the darting and post-darting location of the subject animal to be difficult and hazardous to both man and elephant. Innovation in both methodology and strategy occurred as various delivery systems and technological aids were field tested, the lessons learned should prove useful in undertaking large mammal immobilization under dense forest conditions.

Osborn, Ferrel V.	Ecology of crop raiding elephants	Pachyderm	1998	Meeting proceedings	25	40	40	This three year monitoring study examined the ecology of bull elephants which raid crops in the area adjacent to Sengwa Wildlife Research Area (SWRA). The multi-disciplinary approach included information on human settlement patterns and socio-economic impacts of crop loss in addition to data on the ecology of elephants which cause crop damage. Two general conclusions were: crop raiding is triggered by a decline in the quality of wild grasses inside SWRA rather than the conditions of agricultural crops outside it; and, elephant feed on wild browse in the communal areas because fire and elephants have reduced the availability of preferred tree species within SWRA. A capsicum-based repellent was found to be a potentially effective alternative to traditional deterrents.	MRigby	pachy025.98.039.040.pdf

Hoare, Richard E.	Human-elephant interactions at the ecosystem level	Pachyderm	1998	Meeting proceedings	25	42	42	Elephant populations in the Sebungwe region were studied over a 15,000 sq kms range of mixed natural habitat and human land use. Abundance, spatial organization, and social ecology were compared between a) populations resident in protected wildlife areas, and b) communal lands with human populations. Trends in numbers and densities compiled for the past 16 years, 1980-1996, were stable or declining, contrasting with steadily rising trends of the previous 25 years, 1955-1980. Crude densities outside protected areas rose significantly when converted to ecological densities by excluding human settlement areas, population decline was proportional to agricultural expansion. In communal lands, female elephant home range was estimated to have been compressed by 58% in response to human settlement over the last decade. Widespread displacement of unprotected populations into available refuges was not demonstrated. The prevailing 'linear model' of human-elephant interaction is inapplicable here. An alternative 'flip model' is proposed: elephant and humans coexist at variable levels or abundance until a threshold of land cover transformation is reached in the natural matrix, whereafter elephants disappear.

Garaï, Marion E.	Social organisation in translocated juvenile African elephants; the dominance hierarchy and an intriguing behaviour	Pachyderm	1998	Meeting proceedings	25	43	43	Five groups of penned and four groups of free ranging translocated juvenile African elephants were studied to assess: the establishment of a dominance hierarchy, whether this heirarchy is transitive, and whether their dominance can be measured by the direction of aggressive and submissive behaviour. The relationship between the behaviour 'trunk-over-back' and dominance was investigated. In two penned and three free ranging groups there was a negative correlation between the ranks of 'aggressor' and 'recipient of aggression' and one group showed similar patterns when the data was analysed by sex. In two penned and three free ranging groups there was a positive correlation between the ranks of 'aggressor' and 'recipient of submissive behaviour'. 'Trunk over back' was shown mainly by males, or by the most dominant individual in a group. Trunk-mouth-contact was seen mainly within the context of play and play-fighting. It is suggested that this behaviour is one of appeasement to reduce aggressive motivation and prevent it from escalating to harmful levels, and that it is ritualized.	MRigby	pachy025.98.042.043.pdf

Elephant contraception research in the Kruger National Park	Pachyderm	1998	Meeting proceedings	25	45	52	Reviews two immunocontraception methods used for cow elephant in Kruger NP recently: porcine zon pellucida immuno-contraceptiove vaccine (pZP), and hormonal control using subcutaneous oestradiol-17B (Oestrogen) implants. In terms of effectiveness the oestradial implants proved successful in that none of the treated cows was pregnant after 6 months, the end of the expected life of the implant, nor were any pregnant after 12 months, which may have been due to amounts of estrogen still being released by implants preventing ovulation or a more permanent effect on the ovaries. However, due to the fact that during the first six months the cows implanted with oestradiol-17B exhibited behavioural aberrances (these animals were harrassed by bulls) which resulted in substantially increased stress levels on the treated cows and their calves, the project has been temporarily suspended. The pZP technique had been demonstrated to be effective in other locations, but after 12 months ultrasonographic examination showed 8 of the 19 treated cows were pregnant. Both methods require further research.	MRigby	pachy025.98.045.052.pdf
Tchamba, Martin N.	Habitudes migratoires des elephants et interactions homme-elephant dans la region de Waza-Logone (Nord-Cameroun)	Pachyderm	1998	Meeting proceedings	25	53	66	Three subpopulations exist in the Waza NP region: a sedentary group with a range of about 785 sq kms; a group which during the dry season migrates towards Kalamaloue NP 80 km north of Waza, and returns to Waza NP early in the rainy season; and, a group which migrates southwards into the Kaele region at the beginning of the rainy season, and returns to Waza early in the dry season. The range of the latter two groups are about 3,066 and 1,577 - 2,604 sq kms respectively. The 1991 estimated elephant population in the area was 1,100 (perhaps up to 1,400). Crop raiding elephants in southern Waza during the rainy season have increased from 50 in 1991 to 330 in 1997. Official estimates of the annual crop damage of 200 ha at US$382,000 is an overestimate in the order of  46%. However, the US$51,000 revenue generated from elephant related tourism cannot compensate for damage incurred. Loss of human life due to elephants is rare, and elephant mortality caused by humans is negligible. Conflict reduction measures: fencing, translocation of problem animals or financial compensation, should include legislative reforms and assistance to reinforce local wildlife management capacity.

Thouless, Chris R.	Variability in ranging behaviour of elephants in northern Kenya.	Pachyderm	1998	Meeting proceedings	25	67	73	Intensive study 1990-1992 and continued monitoring of  'migrant animals' over the next 5 years found elephants of Kenya's northern Laikipia and Samburu Districts utilize numerous habitats and have widely variable home ranges - from 150 sq kms to over 5000 sq kms. Elephants resident in the private ranches of Laikipia are believed to have moved south from Samburu during 1970s and 1980s in response to intensive poaching. It was anticipated a decrease in poaching would cause elephant to spend more time in the northern part of their range thus reducing pressure on vegetation and farms in the south, but monitoring showed no consistent northward shift of ranges during 1993-1997. However, monitoring of animals from differing subpopulations illustrates ranges of some individual matrilines have changed substantially during this time, possiblity due to increasing levels of human disturbance. There is much more overlap between different groupings and more variability within subpopulations than previously suspected.	MRigby	pachy025.98.067.073.pdf
Bhima, Roy	Elephant status and conflict with humans on the western bank of Liwonde National Park, Malawi.	Pachyderm	1998	Meeting proceedings	25	74	80	The status of elephants in the western edge of Liwonde NP, an area they have only occupied since 1972, and the relationship these animals have come to have with the agricultural land use outside the boundaries of their protected area were assessed. Aerial and ground surveys were used to estimate herd size and sex ratios, and assess movements. Sampling of crop damage and identification of the animals responsible was done as far as possible. Even though the potential for conflict was high the overall crop damage was calculated at only 10-25%. The attributing factors appear to be the availability of sufficient natural forage elsewhere and the relatively small number of adult bulls in the area. As bulls frequented the crops 5.8 times more than females, a lack of numbers lowers the potential effect from such 'crop raiders'.	MRigby	pachy025.98.074.080.pdf

Pachyderm	1998	Meeting proceedings	25	81	92	Reviews December 1996 to May 1997 Global Postioning System (GPS) trials based on results from two bulls radio collared in Amboseli NP: M86 (38 years and in musth when collared) tracked for 134 days, and M169 (34 years) tracked for 168 days. The collars, containing the GPS instrument and VHF modem package on top with a battery pack at the bottom, were successful in obtaining fixes in 94.6% or 2,966 times out of 3,136 and 96.5% or 2,638 out of 2,734 attempts. Failure to log positions peaked just before dawn with a subsidiary low one hour after midday, these may be due to the animals lying down or being under shade trees. On average each elephant was located 20 times per day and downloadings conducted with a light aircraft every two weeks. Results were converted to speadsheets (MS Excel) from which maps were created using MapInfo software. Daily and hourly movements were plotted. Trials demonstrate GPS radio tracking of elephants is feasible and capable of generating high quality data 24 hours a day and under all weather conditions.	MRigby	pachy025.98.081.092.pdf
Thouless, Chris R.	Proposal for incorporation of grid-based data into the African Elephant Database.	Pachyderm	1998	Meeting proceedings	25	94	94	Suggests the inclusion of a grid based distributional system within the AED would be more objective and provide an indication of data quality that the present mapping system. Data included in grid based system could differentiately weighed be based on: the intensity of the aerial survey and the season in which it is flown, the knowledge of long term competent observers regarding the the range/habitat use; the observation of rapid surveys or transects in an area. Proposes considering grid cells size for mapping data be the equivalent to the quarter degree normal in bird atlases. The grid cell data: density estimate, signs observed, not range, no records, or no information, will be correlated and summarized in sets of tables.	MRigby	pachy025.98.093.094.pdf

A 1997 aerial survey in the southern sector of the Park, which serves as the main rhino and elephant habitat noted significant poaching activity.  A March/April survey in the same area suggested much less poaching activity. Observations recorded 29 fresh and 1 old elephant carcass in June 1997,  and 1 fresh and 101 old carcasses.  The 1995 population estimate for Garamba was 11175 elephants with 3679 in the southeastern part of the Park, the 1998 estimate was 5487 with  1339 being in the southeastern portion.

Animals move between the two nations and  into southern Burkina Faso.  Interviews in Ghana involved people from 42 villages in 7 districts, in Togo from 24 villages in 6 districts (prefectures). Crop raiding is a problem throughout the area but the frustration level in this part of Togo was so high in the late 1980s that Ghanian hunters were encouraged to come in - about 200 elephant were killed between 1989 mid 1991. Now there are no elephant in Keran NP nor in Galangashie and Barkoissi Reserves, but they are seen seasonally in the Doung-Pana area and along the Oti River. In the adjacent area of Ghana they are observed seasonally along Sissili River and the Red Volta and Morago River valleys.  They still move between Togo, Ghana and Burkina Faso, but the traditional route between Ghana and Togo's Fosse-aux-Lions NP (a significant proportion of the Park is cultivated) is disappearing. The population status in the area needs to be investigated.	MRigby	pachy026.98.052.060.pdf
Sam, Moses Kofi; Barnes, Richard F.

A 1991 aerial survey estimated 130 elephants in the region between Fosse-aux-Lions NP and the Doung Forest area and although no censuses have been taken since the present estimate is 100-150. Elephant moved from Togo to Ghana during the 1990-92 political disturbances when local people in Togo took over protected areas. Interviewed villagers in Ghana in 1996 said crop raiding had increased over the last decade, and particularly the past 4-5 years. 37 of the 66 villages (42 in Ghana and 24 in Togo) visited reported damaged crops. The majority of people said elephants were simply destroyers of crops, but there is some belief in medicinal value of dung, and one group in the Pana area of Togo claimed to revere elephants as ancestors. Human population increase and resultant land use needs play a disturbing role in elephant range, this coupled with apparent changes in rainfall and loss of soil fertility do not auger well for conservation.

The other seven were darted from a helicopter. The author suggests a standardized initial darting technique, a high dosage of M99 which seems to induce lateral recumbency, and quick revival of any animal seen to be in difficulty.

Animals from the third group cause extensive damage to crops in the Mindif region during the wet season. In order to find more of about the movements and home ranges of these animals 2 cows were radio collared and monitored using satellite and VHF telemetry during 1994-1997. The Maga Dam and irrigated rice scheme developed in the late 1970s had changed the ecology of the Chari-Logone floodplain and hence the lives of the southern elephant group. Artifical reflooding begun in 1994 changed the ecology again. This monitoring programme saw a change in habitat, but the increased forage in the Park did not decrease the migration of elephants to the south. More work on this conflict situation is needed.

Monitoring human-elephant conflict through remotely located stations	Pachyderm	1999	Field Notes	27	66	68	Changing land use patterns in the Masai Mara ecosystem, particularly the development of sedentary agriculture has provided for increasing human-elephant conflict in Masai Mara Reserve area. About 16 temporary stations, called outposts, manned by a few rangers in radio contact the regional headquarters, have been established outside the Reserve to monitor and response to conflict situations.  Conflict situations are recorded in the occurrence books include: habitat encroachment, crops damage, human deaths and injuries, poaching activities, animals killed during control operations. Recorded data show that between 1987/88 and 1995/1996 60 people have been killed by elephants and 88 elephants have been killed by people in the Reserve area. One the rangers greatest frustrations is the fact that they have to keep appeasing families of the victims, knowing compensation is a long process and the renumeration when it does come is very small.

The Mount Kenya area and Imenti FR to the northeast have been divided into four area blocks wherein a series of line transects totally 263 km positioned to dissect all altitude clines and forest types. Evidence of poaching, logging, elephant paths, dung, and direct observation of mammals are recorded. Position and distance are calculated using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and topofil. Aerial photography was taken at 500m and 1km intervals depending on the extent and occurrence of disturbances in a survey of Mount Kenya, and Imenti and Ndare Ngare FRs that divided the area into 9 blocks. Results of each damage or threat were incorporated into a GPS using ArcView. Elephants tend to avoid steep slopes and areas with intense human presence. When calculated as a percentage of the total number of observations per forest type and proportional to the transect length walked in each forest type the presence of elephant was highest in bamboo/Podocarpus forests (28.9%) in forest clearing/open spaces (26.9%) and in bushland (20.1%)	MRigby	pachy027.99.069.073.pdf

Ben-Shahar, Raphael	Elephants and their woodland habitats in northern Botswana	Pachyderm	1999	Review and Opinion	27	101	104	The elephant population in northern Botswana (estimated to be some 80,000)is considered the largest remaining 'herd' in Africa. This paper looks at this population and its habitat in terms of its current status, the their food and water requirements, their keystone role in the ecology of the area, and management options. These animals maintain seasonal movements, congregating in the northern rivers and parts of the Okavango Delta during the dry season, and dispersing at the onset of the rains. Availability of surface water is a prime factor regulating the abundance of elephants, and restricting their movements particularly toward the end of the dry season. The spatial patterns of vegetation utilization are influenced by the extent of local elephant aggregations. The author notes his synopsis, based on 8 years of field work, 'will demonstate that while elephants have a significant role in the regulation of the natural processes in this ecosystem, it is unlikely that a future increase in elephant densities will induce irreversible change in habitats.' He suggests that the region can sustain a higher population than its current estimate without incurring biodiversity loss.	MRigby	pachy027.99.101.104.pdf

The population estimate is about 3000 elephant, they were widely distributed with the exception of the eastern or Koakrana area where none were present during either survey.  Densities were quite variable with the distributions being wider in the rainy season.  The average group size was 6.7 during the dry season and 6.0 in the wet. This number does not seem to pose a problem vis a vis the human population, nor does the vegetation appear degraded.  The onset of the rains seemed to be a centripedal movement towards the centre of the areas flown. The only movement towards the outside of the area was in the south where animals crossed the Pendjari River. Approximately two thirds of the numbers are concentrated in the Singou Basin.

Demeke, Yirmed; Afework Bekele	Study on the elephants of Mago National Park, Ethiopia	Pachyderm	2000	Research and Method	28	32	43	A dung count survey plus ground observation of elephant in Mago NP during June 1997 to April 1998 estimated the population to be between 387 and 575. The maximum number of animals counted from a total of seven sights was 182. They occupy semi-arid bush and riverine valleys. During the past century elephants have become somewhat restricted in their range. They use to inhabit areas near Jinka town, Woito valley, Hamer, areas around Omorate and a large part of Tama Wildlife Reserve. However people coming from the central and northern parts of the country heavily exploited the populations. Data on movement suggest that some elephant may move south travelling up to 43 kms outside the park boundary. Calculated home ranges average 1597 sq kms. During the study period 26 elephants were known to have been killed for ivory. Both poaching and habitat destruction are threats to maintaining a elephant population in the Park.

Mubalama, Leonard Kakira	Population and distribution of elephants (Loxodonta africana africana) in the central sector of the Virunga National Park, Eastern DRC	Pachyderm	2000	Research and Method	28	44	55	Savannah elephant were observed in the central sector of Virunga NP almost continuously over a three month period, April-July 1998, during a study to ascertain their population status and distribution. Direct observation suggests Virunga NP supports 486 to 535, ranging over about 2400 sq kms. A 1959 survey estimated the elephant population in the central sector of the Park to be 3293 and they were considered to be fairly common thoughout the Park. By the mid 1980s the population had probably declined to 621-674 and by 1990 it was considered  <500 elephant remained in bushland and frequently congregated into 2 or 3 large herds. This study was restricted to the central part of the Park, comprising the Rwindi-Rutshuru-Ishasha plains. Although the animals were undisturbed during the study they tended to prefer thick bush, bushed grassland and gallery forests and occurred in large groups. The three main herds were: the Ishasha herd of about 175 in the eastern area which may split into two with part of the group going into Queen Elizabth NP in Uganda; the Rutshuru herd of about 140 moving between Rutshuru delta and Nyabushi; and the Lula-Muhaha of about 65 which spend time around the Tchanika swamp and the lakeshore.

Martin, Esmond Bradley	Egyptian government seizes illegal ivory consignments	Pachyderm	2000	Field Notes	28	56	57	In spite of  being a party to CITES Egypt has one of the largest retail ivory markets in Africa, as illustrated by the over 21000 ivory carvings observed in retail outlets in Cairo, Luxor and Aswan during the author's 1998 visit.  Raw tusks generally come from Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and much of the retail  sales of worked ivory are to tourists. According to ETIS files the Egyptian  government  reported no ivory seizures from 1989 to mid 1999, however between September 1999 and April 2000 there were nine seizures comprised of 162 pieces of raw and worked ivory with a total weight of 327 kilograms. The largest seizure was that of 79 raw tusks totally 173 kilograms taken from a Egyptian trader in Aswan.	MRigby	pachy028.00.056.057.pdf
Galanti, Valeria; Rossi, Rossella; Tosi, Guido; Foley, Charles A. H.; Foley, Lara S.	Elephant capture, collaring and radio-tracking in Tarangire National Park, Tanzania	Pachyderm	2000	Field Notes	28	58	59	Tarangire hosts about 2000 elephant, the largest population in northern Tanzania. During the rainy season most of the large  herbivores, including elephant, leave the Park and disperse into the Masai Steppe region.  In November 1997 5 cows, representing three different subpopulations of elephant found within the Park, were radio collared: one from the northern group, and two each from groups in the central and southern subpopulations. In February 1999 three collars were replaced  and two additional animals were collared. Movements of the collared animals are tersely reviewed. The map illustrates that cows from the northern and central subgroups moved within the immediate area and for the most part remained in the Park. Those of the southern subpopulation moved much more widely and traversed areas well into the Kiketo region to the southeast  -  both cows moved rapidly and at night.	MRigby	pachy028.00.058.059.pdf

Projects of the Human-Elephant Conflict Taskforce (HETF) - results and recommendations	Pachyderm	2000	Review and Opinion	28	73	77	Notes the development recognition of the need for and the development of the Taskforce focused on human elephant conflict (HEC) -  a 5 person group offically established by AfESG in 1997. During the first phase, yielded aN inventory of conflict sites, a bibliography of available literature, a list of priority topics for further investigation, and terms of reference for the Taskforce itself were compiled. The second phase continues to evolve around 3 activities: linking people with similar interests, acting as a catalyst in getting studies underway, and providing technical advice and expertise to range states. To date 8 studies under three categories have been completed: 4 under determination of significant factors in HEC, 3 under spatial analysis of HEC, and 1 under control of problem elephants. Elephants appear to attract a disproportionate level of complaintS - elephant raids are localised, unpredictable, and do cause more damage per raid than other pests, but are not the significant pest they are perceived to be. Human-elephant conflict in the forest ecosystem has not been as widely researched as that in the savannas, but this conflict may be a pretext for elephant poaching. Research and management recommendations are outlined.	MRigby	pachy028.00.073.077.pdf
Milewski, Antoni V.	Iodine as a possible controlling nutrient for elephant populations	Pachyderm	2000	Review and Opinion	28	78	90	The geography and physiology of iodine deficiency in humans and domestic ungulates suggests that the nutritional content of ground water may hold a key to humane and efficient management of elephant populations. Artificial bore hole water in dry climates in southern Africa appears to be, on  the average, a good supplement of this easily leached element., an may have inadvertently boosted the reproductive rates of elephants in several conservation areas. Elephant are likely to be limited by deficiency of iodine: their plant foods are deficient in this element relative to the hormonal requirements associated with exceptional brain and thyroid size. Extrapolation from domestic ecosystems suggests elephants exceed meduim sized wild herbivores in the sensitivty of their reproductive rates to subclinical deficiency of iodine. The great variation iodine concentrations between adjacent aquifers suggests an approach to population control: closure of iodine rich bole holes in overpopulated areas may reduce rates of sexual maturation, conception, birth and weaning with a minimum artifical distress to adults or surviving juveniles.

The AZA Elephant SSP is an example of a programme where captive breeding and exhibition programmes can be of great value to in situ conservation both directly and indirectly. Examples of the value of public education, scientific research into reproductive biology, the testing of relevant technology and the training of veterinarian and biological support staff area discuss. Zoos can and do raise funds for field conservation. The authors end the paper by outlining cooperative ventures and information exchange between AZA and IUCN/SSC.	MRigby	pachy028.00.101.109.pdf

Changes in elephant demography, reproduction and group structure in Tsavo National Park (1966-1994)	Pachyderm	2000	Research	29	15	24	Demography, reproductive status and group dynamics of 557 individually recognized African elephants in Tsavo East NP were assessed in relationship to poaching, the environment, and past research findings. In 1994 more than half of the population number sampled was >20 years old. The 20 and under age classes were skewed in favour of males while females dominated the >21 year age classes, and there were few males >35 years.  No known female <15 years was accompanied by a newborn, and the average intercalf interval was 5 years. Males in musth were observed year round. Mean group size was large with aggregations >50 sighted during the dry season. Almost half the surveyed female groups were missing an older matriarch, or contained calves and juveniles that were not the offspring of the females present. The skewed sex structure, large group size  and fragmented family groups were attributed to disruptions caused by poaching.	MRigby	pachy029.00.015.024.pdf
Hoare, Richard E.	Effects of habitat on visibility of elephants during aerial census	Pachyderm	2000	Research	29	25	28	Relocating individual radiocollared elephants during an aerial survey in northern Zimbabwe provided an opportunity to assess the  effects of habitat and topography on the aerial visibility of elephants. Sightings were considered 'failed' when no elephants could be seen by aerial observers after the aircraft had flown  in a tight circle around the radiocollar signal for some 8 minutes. These situations,  which amounted to 15%  (n=88) of the sightings, all occured in steep, rocky hills covered with high-canopy woodland and  incised by narrow, thickly wooded valleys. This type of terrain did not cover enough of the study area to affect the accuracy of  the census estimate. However, this trial served to illustrate localized failure rates of elephant visibility which can be appreciated by those seeking to improve routine census techniques.	MRigby	pachy029.00.025.028.pdf
Mipro, Hien; Joseph, Boussim I.; Sita, Guinko	Elephants et dissemination des graines de quelques espèces vegetales dans le Ranch de Gibier de Nazinga (sud du Burkina Faso)	Pachyderm	2000	Research	29	29	38	Seed dispersal by  forest elephants was assessed from dung samples collected monthly July 1996-June 1997. Seeds contained in the dung piles were counted and natural germination was simulated. Seed densities varied  significantly between months, with a maximum in April, suggesting that fruits replace green forage as the food supply for elephants during the dry season. The seeds collected at the beginning of the dry season germinated at a higher rate that those collected towards the end of the season. Elephants dispersed about 20% of the woody species at various habitats of the study area. Results illustrate that elephant feed on fruits mainly during the dry season, and that they play an important  role  in disseminating seeds in the Nazinga area.	MRigby	pachy029.00.029.038.pdf

Muoria, Paul Kimata	Population estimate of elephants in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest	Pachyderm	2000	Field Notes	29	48	51	This 1996 study was undertaken to determine the change in the elephant population in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest since a 1991 survey  had estimated 78 to 90 animals occupied the area.  Dung decay rate was estimated using two methods: reciprocal of the mean survival time,  which yielded an estimate of  0.34  elephants per sq km;  and, two points on the exponential curve, which gave an estimate of  0.46  per sq km. These estimates respectively translated into 126 to 172 elephants in the area as a whole.  Results suggest the elephant population in the forest has increased substantially. Reports of crop raiding on farms adjacent to the forest have been noted.  There is a need to monitor the elephant population to safeguard the forest's biodiversity  and since there have been  reports of crop raiding on farms adjacent to the forest it is important to watch for higher crop-raiding intensities and the conflict situations this would cause.

Over 100,000 elephant ivory items for retail  sale were observed  with the largest number noted in Abidjan (20,114), Harare (19,958) and Cairo (11,627). Except for Egypt, Gabon and Sudan domestic trade is legal. However, most buyers are foreign tourists (mostly French, Spanish and Italian), Chinese and Korean workers and businessmen, French military, United Nations officials and national diplomats. Except for Zimbabwe, the export of ivory commodities is illegal.  There is a significant  movement of  illicit tusks within Africa., particularly from central to west to satisfy local carving industries. Countries with the cheapest tusks include Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic,  Cameroon and Mozambique where relatively large elephant populations and little law enforcement exist. Illegal trade of tusks off the continent exists, mostly to countries in eastern Asia. Since 1988 the price for most retail ivory items has decreased due to decline in demand and devaluation of local currencies.  The price of tusks has also sharply declined.  The only surveyed city with increased retail sales since 1990 was Lagos, but  it seems Abidjan has retails have expansed since the mid-1990's."	MRigby	pachy030.01.024.036.pdf

The distribution of elephants was estimated by dung counts on transects, and the habitat use was documented by trail mapping.  Dung density incresed with the distance to the forest border and to the nearest village. Elephant appeared to use about 60% of the forest regularly, the rest they avoided because of foresty operations and human presence. The main influence on the spatial distribution of elephants in the study area was human presence, followed by ahbitat structure. Forest roads, regardless of usage, seemed to have no influence on elephant distribution.  Elephant avoided coffee and cocoa plantations in all seasons. During the dry season they walked more often through forest parts with greater tree canopy cover than during the wet season, when they avoided valley bottoms.	MRigby	pachy030.01.037.043.pdf
Hoare, Richard E.	Management implications of new research on problem elephants	Pachyderm	2001	Research and Review	30	44	48	The persistance of problem elephant behaviour appears to continue, at least in some populations,  even when identified culprit individuals are routinely removed from these populations over a long time.  Is it possible that elephant populations, rather than having a few habitual problem animals,  may have what could be termed a problem component? Neither translocation or killing  of problem animals appears to work, others simply take their place. This implies that in such populations either translocation or killling of  problem anaimls will have to continue indefinately. Although difficult to test this reasoning is supported by considerable circumstantial evidence and agrees with accepted principles in agricultural pest cntrol. Merely killing (removing) individuals of the pest species seldom has much impact of the problem, most pests are effectively controlled by denying them their target food or a nearby refuge.

Dual-season crop damage by elephants in eastern Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe	Pachyderm	2001	Research and Review	30	49	56	Reviews an elephant -focused crop damage reporting scheme, developed and tested for two consecutive years in Muzarabani District in Zimbabwe's eastern Zambezi Valley.  The scheme, which involves reports collected by an enumerator who visits the site of every incident in  his ward, assesses wet and dry season crop damage, identifies spatial and and temporal patterns, and develops a measure of serverity for each incident. Within the Muzarabani  study area the majority of elephant crop raiding incidents occurred during the wet season. Dry season crop damage, considered to be unusual, was found to be relatively common. Wet season crop damage occurred primarily in farmland along the edge of a protected wildlife area, while dry season crop damage occurred along the major rivers in the District. Although fewer in number the dry season incidents were generally more severe than wet season incidents. Crop damage in the dry season may have a greater impact on rural farmers since that is when food is scarce. The system of crop damage reporting developed in this study provided objective and practical management information for the local district council and has been adopted by the AfESG Human-Elephant Conflict Taskforce.

de Boer, Fred; Ntumi, Cornelio P.	Elephant crop damage and electric fence construction in the Maputo Elephant Reserve, Mozambique	Pachyderm	2001	Research and Review	30	57	64	A 38 km electric fence is being constructed along part of the western border of the Maputo Elephant Reserve. At present the cost of the fence construction and maintenance (estimated at 41,500 USD per year) far outweighs the cost of crop damage (estimated about 8800 USD per year), but is considered that the fence will eventually not only lead to a decrease in crop damage by elephants but will  contribute to better control of poaching and of access by people to the Reserve. During 1996 and 1997 crop raiding information was gleaned from data sheets completed by 12 informants from 8 different villages surrounding the Reserve and followup investigations of complaints received during meetings held in each of villages. Elephants preferred maize, melons and beans, and the raid frequency was highest during harvest seasons and the proportion of crop damage was higher on the more productive fields. In the most affected areas, 90% of the farmers reported crop damage and 26% of the crops were lost to elephants. The total damaged area was about 10% of 983 ha of cultivated fields. Most farmers felt the traditional methods of frightening elephants were not effective, and chose the option of constructing an electric fence.	MRigby	pachy030.01.057.064.pdf

Elephants as agents of seed dispersal in Aberdare and Tsavo National Parks, Kenya	Pachyderm	2001	Research and Review	30	70	74	This study used two quite different habitats to illustrate the role of the elephant as an agent of seed dispersal: Aberdare NP, a mountainous forest region in central  Kenya, and the Tsavo ecosystem which is largely comprised of arid bushland  in south eastern part of the country. 18 plant species (15 herbs, 2 shrubs and 1 tree) belonging to 12 families germinated  from elephant dung samples obtained in Tsavo.  36 species (27 herbs, 3 shrubs and 6 trees) belonging to 19 families germinated from samples obtained in the Aberdares. Results of  the dung analysis and seed germination trials indicate that many plant species are dispersed by elephants, and for some of these species elephant may be the obligate agents of dispersal. Removing elephants from their natural ranges or restricting their movements using electric fences may result in serious implications with far reaching ecological impacts on species diversity in the long term.

At least 52 plant species were observed to germinate naturally from elephant dung in the forest. Seedlings of 84 plant species germinated from irrigated elephant dung. This study showed that elephant are important seed dispersal agents in this ecosystem.  The fact that seeds of cultivated plants were observed in the dung suggests that land use conflict with the local community is an inherent problem and will become more evident  in any time.

Slotow, Rob; Balfour, Dave; Howison, Owen	Killing of black and white rhinoceroses by African elephants in Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park, South Africa	Pachyderm	2001	Research and Review	31	14	20	Between 1991 and 2001 elephants killed 58 white and  5 black rhinos in Hluhluwe-Umfolozi. The culprits were primarily young male elephant entering musth at a younger than normal age due to the absence of older bulls.  Elephant bulls (17-25 years) translocated as young animals from Kruger NP culls had no older male hierarchy, and were entering into musth as early as 18 as opposed to an average age of 28. (Poole 1987).  Carcasses were often found in the vicinity of rivers,  76% being within 1 km of a river. Rhinos killed were predominately adult (86%), and slightly more males than females. This situation was similar to that in  Pilanesberg NP (50 white rhinos killed 1992-1997) which was suppressed when 6 older bulls were introduced. In  May 2000 10 older bulls from Kruger NP were introduced to Hluhluwe-Umfolozi. The number of rhino deaths decreased immediately, between September 2000 and October 2001 only 2 were killed  (both in June 2001). Results suggest when rhino are present in an area older male elephants should be brought into a population of young introduced animals, but numbers should be on the conservative side monitored  to assess vegetation/habitat utilization as well as interspecific aggression.

Large scale poaching activities were evident, with 17 new or recent poaching camps reported. 20 poachers were caught with evidence (111 kg raw ivory and 215 kg elephant meat). 17 weapons (small machine guns) and 331 rounds of ammunition were confiscated by a 34 man team of Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) and Armee Populaire Congolaise (APC) personnel.  All active law enforcement was vested in a closely supervised rapid deployment strike force based at Epulu. The force undertook armed patrols throughout the Reserve,  manned observation at strategic vantage points, and responded to intelligence reports or calls for assistance from the outposts. 3 months prior to the launch of Operation Tango less than 10% of the Reserve was under wildlife management authority control. After 5 months of the Operation no new signs of poaching were found.  Future management needs/objectives are discuss.	MRigby	pachy031.01.036.041.pdf

Garaï, Marion E.; Carr, Richard D.	Unsuccessful introductions of adult elephant bulls to confined areas in South Africa	Pachyderm	2001	Research and Review	31	52	57	This study assessed the reasons why some mature elephant bull introductions to game-fenced properties have been unsuccessful.  Between 1998-2000 71 adult bulls from Kruger NP were transferred to 15 properties.  Break-outs, circumstances where bulls broke out of a functional electrified perimeter fence, or a release boma and a perimeter fence and did not return, occurred in 5 properties. Observations suggest the 8 bulls involved had not developed a respect for electric fencing, but this investigation was unable to identify particular common factors that may lead to break-outs. However, several factors appear to influence break-outs including: the construction and electrification  components used in the release boma; the age, social staus and number of bulls introduced; the proximity to their previous range; and the presence of established founder family groups.  These are discuss and related to specific break-outs, and recommendations associated with each are reviewed.  Suggests the most important aspect to introducing and establishing elephants in a new environment and specifically into small, confined areas is the training period in the release boma, and if this involves initiation to electric fencing it is at this point a lasting respect must be developed.

Danquah, Emmanuel K.

Most of the animals were found in the vicinity of the Suhien River.  A pre-study reconnaissance had statified the areas into three stata, low, medium and high, based on assumed density. However, the study suggests it would be better to have a two stata system and arrange the high density stratum along the Suhien  River. All 43 dung piles observed were on the 16 transects in the high density strata near the River.  This 509 sq km Conservation Area  which covers the two adjacent forests of  Nuni-Suhian NP and the Ankasa Resource Reserve  in southwestern Ghana appears to house the smallest elephant population in Ghana's forest zone.  It is an important plant diversity region and has been only lightly logged  thus far. It is important to monitor the elephant population in order to assess whether it is isolated or if the estimated 21 elephant  move between Ankasa and the Draw River FR.	MRigby	pachy031.01.063.069.pdf

Earlier survey results noted 150 during a one day survey in May 1969 in the vicinity of the Gambia River,  200 were estimated to be present in a May 1970 survey, about 50 in 1985, and 30 in 1993.  The ground  survey between April and July 2000  suggested  4 animals (2 adults and 2 juveniles) were present in the transected area within the Park's southern region.  Only 4 animals (2 adults, one male and one female and two juveniles were observed duirng 21 hours of aerial survey time. Results suggest that less than 30 elephant may be present in the area and  the future for elephant here is very uncertain. Poaching has been a problem for many years and  a skull and bones seen during the survey suggest it may casue for concern.	MRigby	pachy031.01.070.072.pdf
Keigwin, Michael	Elephants, crops and people in Ushasha Sector, southern Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda	Pachyderm	2001	Field Notes	31	73	74	Reviews the implementation and ongoing programme of the Elephants, Crops and People (ECP) project in the southern section of Queen Elizabeth NP which assesses the status of elephants, and  works in cooperation with the Uganda Wildlife Authority and local farmers to find ways to mitigate elephant-human conflict interactions.  The  monitoring  programme was based on the standardized interaction monitoring system used in Virunga NP. During the first month over 150 separate crop-raiding  incidents recorded. All occurred at night, bull, family groups and large aggregations, sometimes numbering  over 150 animals. Results indicate most incidents happen during the wet season when elephants come into the Park  by crossing the Ishasha River,  the boundary between Uganda and  Democratic Republic of Congo in this area.  The transmigration route is monitored by a EPC team walking the 25 km stretch of the Ishasa River and recording evidence of  elephants at crossing places. Although  the aggregations are large, the old animals are few, and the animals show some fear the population contains an abundance of young and subadults and appears to be increasing.  Monitoring and research work continue.	MRigby	pachy031.01.073.074.pdf

Hillman Smith, A. K. Kes	Status of northern white rhinos and elephants in Garamba National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo, during the wars	Pachyderm	2001	Rhino Notes	31	79	81	In recent years meat has been the premis behind poaching in Garamba NP. Patrol records suggest 70-80% of the poachers are Sudanese, often  SPLA deserters, and the rest are Congolese.  The significant increase in  poaching  in 1997 during the first DRC war was related to the fact that the guards were disarmed by occupying military forces and so had no control over poaching. There was no increase during the second DRC war, 1999-2000, although the Park  headquarters was occupied by Ugandan-backed rebel forces, the personnel were not disarmed and there was little disruption to their anti-poaching efforts.  Aerial  survey counts in 1995 estimated 11,175 elephant. In May-June 1998, the estimated population was 5874, and in 2000 it was 6022. Observations suggest one half the elephants were lost during the first war, but there was no significant loss during the initial phase of the second war. Recent genetic results illustrate what observers have long suggested: Garamba elephants appear morphologially and behaviourly to be an intergrade between forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) and savannah elephant (Loxodonta  africana africana).  International assistance focused on Garamba is noted.	MRigby	pachy031.01.079.081.pdf

Ouattara, Soulemane	Conflits homme-éléphant autour de la Forêt Classée du Haut Sassandra (Côte d'Ivoire)	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	32	12	21	Complaints regarding crop damage in the area surrounding Haut-Sassandra FR in western Ivory Coast  were cause for  this 1995 study involving questionnaires and on site crop damage assessment. Located along the Tiemba, a tributary of the Sassandra River, the Reserve is the largest of several protected areas which provide elephant range and habitat to move within thoughout much of the year.  Crop destruction near the Reserve boundaries occurs, for the most part, during the dry season (December through February). The main food crops destroyed were taro, banana, casava, pineapple and yam, but cocoa which is a cash crop also suffered. The damage itself was not extensive. Only about 5% of the farmers income was affected in  1995, but the destruction angers the people and has caused some killing of  elephants.  Research suggests that if something is not done to lessen the conflict the problem will escalate.  Recommendations include: development of permanent water sources in  the forest, assistance to farmers in making their fields safer from destruction and/or assistance in moving their field locations, further studies into the movement or possible migration of the elephant between the forest reserves or protected areas.

Milewski, Antoni V.	Elephant diet at the edge of the Fynbos Biome, South Africa	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	32	29	38	Reviews observations of two forest guards who from 1990 to 2000 noted the diet and preferred foods of Knysna elephants, in the Fnybos Biome along the southern coastal region of  South Africa. All plants eaten by five elephants, the last three known native animals and two introduced juveniles,  were noted 'this is the first evidence that elephants routinely eat the nutrient-poor, heathy shrubs and wiry grasslike plants of the fynbos'.   The native animals spent 90% of their time in the forest, but when released in 1994 the introduced juveniles only spent  2 months in this habitat. From then on they spent: 80% in fynbos and rough pasture, 10% in patchy  forest, 5% in mature tree plantations, and less than 5% near vegetable/croplands which they raided.  11 species of  forest trees and shrubs were eaten,  Rapanea,  Pterocelastrus, and Ilex seemed to be preferred. The introduced juveniles mainly ate bark when in the forest. Most of the common genera of shrubs and grasslike plants of the fynbos were eaten, but most herbaceous plants were ignored. Exotic trees in plantations were occasionally damaged  for their bark and many Acacia, particularly A mearnsii  were broken down, and bark, pods and leaves eaten.  The animals sometimes excavated and ate tubers and rhizomes of  herbaceous plants such as Iridaceae and bracken fern (Pterodium) but did not eat soil. The author  notes the complementary diets elephant may have with other indigenous herbivores, and discusses the commonly held view that the Knysna habitat lacks  trace elements. Observations suggest elephant could be maintained in the Fynbos Biome, and their presence in this area might be useful in controlling invasive exotic plants.	MRigby	pachy032.02.029.038.pdf

The free ranging 'elephants were monitored for four months to identify animals to be moved'. From the total of 140 elephants individually identified  56, comprising 9 family units and 9 bulls, were identified for relocation. The paper notes the rationale for the pre-translocation monitoring, outlines the procedures followed by  personnel  in the helicopter and ground teams during the darting and anaesthesia regime, and the subsequent work involved in the loading, transportation and release of the animals.  The animals were translocated in July 2001 during  12 capture operations conducted over a period of 22 days.  Six animals were fitted with radio collars.  Post-release monitoring involved both ground and aerial monitoring. To date it appears that the majority of the animals have settled close to the point of release and range within the Meru ecosystem.

Statut et tendances des effectifs d'éléphants dans les aires protegées de l'Est du Burkina Faso	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	32	49	54	Discusses results of aerial surveys 26 April - 3 May 2000 in Arly NP and vicinity including the Pama Complex and the Singou, Ouamou  areas and compares these to other surveys and population reviews undertaken over the past decade. The present estimate of  a possibility of almost 2400 (1743 =/- 648 at 95% confidence) is sufficiently close to Barnes' 1999 estimate of about 2000 to be considered accurate. The distribution noted in this survey was similar to that noted by Barnes during the wet season. Between 1982 and 1992 there was a significant amount of poaching in this area, but within the past ten years the situation has improved. It is suggested that 200-300 animals came from Togo between 1990 and 1993. The relatively large and interconnected protected areas in this region bode well for maintainence of  the savannah elephant population.  Poaching in the region appears to be limited.  The surveyed area in southwestern Burkina Faso in the vicinity of Arly NP probably supports the largest savannah elephant population in West Africa.	MRigby	pachy032.02.049.054.pdf
Litoroh, Moses W.	Aerial elephant count in the Shimba Hills ecosystem, Kenya	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	32	55	63	Conducted by helicopter in the Shimba Hills ecosystem in August 1997 a one day  wet season count observed 464 elephant, and served to verify the estimated 412 obtained through dung counts.  150 of the animals were in Mwaluganje Forest, giving a density of  6 elephant per sq km in this area.  The population in the Forest has probably  been increasing since the 1950's.  Shimba Hills National Reserve itself  is enclosed by an electric fence. A wildlife corridor, namely the Mwaluganje Community Conservation Area, joins the Reserve and the Forest but there is no additional habitat/range for this isolated population which is literally surrounded by human habitation and agricultural land. Vegetation damage by elephants in the Shimba Hills ecosystem has reached critical  levels in localized areas, and the area's biodiversity may suffer if management action is not taken soon. The author discusses the growth of the population and  the differing opinions of researchers who have undertaken previous surveys. He conclusions are in line with a recent consultant's report (Kamanga, 1997) who suggested 200 animals should be removed, and that a density of  0.5 elephants per sq km is probably good for the Shimba ecosystem. Translocation is suggested  as an option  to consider  followed  up by a population control immunocontraception programme.	MRigby	pachy032.02.055.063.pdf
Foley, Charles A. H.	High incidence of elephant twin births in Tarangire National Park, Tanzania	Pachyderm	2002	Field Notes	32	64	66	Twin births have been remarkably common among 139 individually known adult female elephants studied since 1992/93 in Tarangire NP. 14 or almost 5% of the 291 recorded births have been twins: seven sets have consisted of five sets of a male and a female, and two sets of twin females.  The interbirth intervals of  3, 3, 4, and 6 years, following these twin births thus far are not very different from the 4.5 year interval noted for the nearby Amboseli NP elephants (Moss, 2001).  One female produced three of  the sets consisting of a male and female with the births occurring  mid 1992, April 1996, and April 1999. A second female within the same family group, probably a sister, produced one set of twins and had a single male calf  four years later.  Mortality among twins was high with 6 or 43% of the 14 dying by the age of five.  This may be due to inadequate nutrition when  two calves are suckling , or perhaps it is more difficult  for the cow to keep watch over them.  The population of Tarangire NP has been growing rapidly since 1994 with females and infants increasing at an average rate of 10% per year. Besides perhaps being genetically predisposed this apparent surge of twinning  in Tarangire may have been due in part to the reduction of poaching, and the resulting stabilization of elephant movement and aggregation patterns since 1989, and/or to the exceptional vegetation available as a result of several sequential wet seasons associated with the El Nino phenomenon.  A eight year old male elephant, upon the death of their mother, adopted his three month old female sisters. All three of  these three young elephants appeared healthy during the six months they were observed . 	MRigby	pachy032.02.064.066.pdf

Morule, Thato Barbara	MIKE implementation in Botswana	Pachyderm	2002	Field Notes	32	69	71	This article, based on a paper given at the Fifth AfESG Meeting at Shaba NR in Kenya, is a critical review of the implementation of  the Monitoring of the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE)  in Botswana. The official MIKE site in Botswana is Chobe NP, but as more activities related to elephants are outside the Park the DWNP has extended MIKE activities to other elephant range areas including Chobe East and West adjacent to the Park, the Okavango area north of the buffalo fence, and the northern Tuli Block. The implemention of MIKE is important as Botswana currently holds Africa's largest elephant population:  the present count of 120,000 is growing at 5% per year, most of these animals are in the northern region, but about 800 occur in the Tuli Block in the eastern area along the border with Zimbabwe.  Botswana has appointed a MIKE National Coordinator based in Gaborone, and 3 site coordinators based in Kasane, Mathathane and Maun.Training workshops have been conducted for patrol teams.  The four forms, namely the carcass report, ground control report, monthly report, and annual report are used with the information being forwarded to the southern African regional coordinator in Namibia.  Only the Chobe NP material is being forwarded,  information from the other areas will be kept in a database  for local/national use. To date 24 carcasses have been reported, 13 resulting from natural causes. 11 elephants were poached from the Maikaelelo FR in April/May 2001. Reviews recommendations the MIKE director made on the implementation of the programme in  Botswana, notes 7 problems faced in implementing MIKE, and 5 recommendations to facilitate its implementation.

Bouché, Philippe	Elephant status and conservation in the Upper Bandama Game Reserve, Ivory Coast	Pachyderm	2002	Field Notes	32	72	73	Upper Bandama is the largest game reserve in the Ivory Coast. About 80 elephants were estimated to live in Upper Bandam GR's woodland savannah habitat during the 1980s, but no elephant were observed during a reconnaissance flight in 1996. However, between 1995 and 1999 several people observed elephant when flying over the area, and since large patches of forest are still present inside the Reserve elephant may still exist, but to locate them ground observation may be necessary. During the 1990s the estimate normally given for this area was 40 elephant, but the author suggests that now a more realistic estimate would be 20.  Hunting pressure is high. The animals, if there are any, would have stayed in the Reserve area for protection from hunters and because of increasing conflict with human settlements and domestic stock in the surrounding area.

Dublin, Holly T.	African Elephant Specialist Group	Pachyderm	2002	Chair Reports	33	1	8	This report begins by noting  ongoing work of the Human Elephant Conflict Task Force, including the GIS mapping of  range areas in specific study locations, the work towards translocating  just over a dozen amimals from Arly to Burkina Faos which is the first elephant translocation programme in which AfESG itself is involved.   The text serves as a review of the ongoing work involved in the publication of the African elephant status report (this replaces the African Elephant Database),  a update on MIKE, work being undertaken  by the West African and the Central African offcies,  and 10 studies handled through the small grants programme which. This latter programme which provides funds of 2000-10000 USD allows for young  African researchers to become directly involved in investigations which they have had some responsibility in devising.

Movement of elephants in the Selous-Niassa wildlife corridor, southern Tanzania	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	33	18	31	Reviews elephant distribution and migatory movements through the Selous-Naissa wildlife corridor (SNWC - which at present has no official designation or protection) as obtained from data collected from village public meetings, questionnaire surveys and field observations in the 21 village located within the corridor. The corridor harbours several well-established migratory routes and numerous areas that are important as seasonal or year-round habitat for elephants and other  wildlife. Elephants are abundant,  they are present throughout the year with peak numbers occurring in April and May. Key factors responsible for the movemnts and migrations are thought to be 'availability to water, food and in some places increased disturbances from humans'. The major elephant routes probably depend on large permanent river systems, movements are reported to proceed from south to north between March and April, and  from north to south between June and December.  Three major migratory routes from Ruvuma to the centre of the corridor and four other routes which serve to connect the Ruvuma River and Selous GR have been identified.  Migratory routes from the centre of the corridor to Selous GR are Malimbani, Ritungula and Nampungu ya Chakame while the  Sasawala-Lukumbule route connects the SNWC with Mwambesi GR to the east.  Several routes are plotted as Tree diagrams, one table includes a list of preferred food plants while another outlines major river systems  in the SNWC area.   	MRigby	pachy033.02.018.031.pdf
Osborn, Ferrel V.; Parker, Guy E.	Community-based methods to reduce crop loss to elephants: experiments in the communal lands of Zimbabwe	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	33	32	38	This study compared an experimental community based strategy  for protecting crops with current deterrent methods involved 7 villages in a high elephant population area in Guruve District in northern Zimbabwe. The experimental deterrents included warning systems, barriers and active deterrents and were designed to increase the capacity of the farmers to detect and repel elephants. Presently used methods of deterrence of raiding elephants problematic, traditional deterrents used by  rural farmers become ineffective over time 'and interventions by  NGOs or wildlife authorities tend to be expensive and unsuitable in remote locations'.  Individual experimental methods were more effective at deterring elephants than current traditional methods and the 'integrated strategy' which combined two or more of the deterrent significatnly reduced the total crop damage in the study villages.  Results suggest elephants can be deterred from crop raiding using relatively inexpensive materials that are locally available and that local communities can administer: buffer zones, watchtowers, fire, alarms and noise makers ( drums, firecrakers, cow bells) burning chilli pepper and dung bricks, rocks and other thrown objects.

Sam, Moses Kofi; Haizel, Charles A. K.; Barnes, Richard F. W.	Do cattle determine elephant distribution in the Red Volta Valley of northern Ghana?	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	33	39	42	Elephants in the northeastern Ghana border area adjacent Burkina  Faso  move along the Red Volta River Valley raiding crops enroute, and routinely cross back and forth between the countries.   As much of  the valley area is forest reserve land, in places up to 14 kms wide, elephant can readily  retreat into this refuge after  raiding farmers fields. Data collected in the 1999 planting season were used to test the hypothesis that elephant density was inversely proportional to cattle density.  The authors developed a multivariate model to explain elephant distribution. Having controlled for other variables, results show that increasing numbers of cattle, indicated by the presence of dung,  reduce the probablility of finding elephants outside the forest reserve. The authors suggest 'that cattle grazing could be manipulated to reduce the risk of crop raiding by elephants.	MRigby	pachy033.02.039.042.pdf
Mubalama, Leonard Kakira; Sikubwabo Kiyengo, Claude	Rate of decay of elephant dung in the central sector of Parc National des Virunga, Democratic Republic of Congo	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	33	43	49	"This article focuses on the dung decay analysis undertaken in January-May 1999 as a follow up to the April-July 1998 study of the status and population estimate of elephants in the central part of Virunga NP. (Mubalama 2000)  Excessive growth of Acacia sps and bush invasion into savannah areas as a result of the large scale loss of elephants in the 1970s-1980s disallowed easy observation in this area so researchers chose assess the utility dung counts. This study  assesses the  decay of dung in this area.  During both research periods a sample set of  fresh elephant dung piles was monitored at 14 day intervals. It is considered that the length and seasonal timing of the study periods provide sufficient information to assess dung counts in this area in both the wet and the dry seasons.  The latter time allowed for dung piles to be observed from the time they were fresh until they decomposed and dissappeared. Decomposition is principally brought about by three factors: dung beetles, termites and mechanical disturbances such as heavy rain, fire, trampling and foraging for insects by birds."

Osborn, Ferrel V.	Elephant-induced change in woody vegetation and its impact on elephant movements out of a protected area in Zimbabwe	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	33	50	57	This study, tested the hypothesis that vegetation structure and relative abundance of certain plants in remnant forest fragments differ from forests found within protected areas, and that this situation may be a causal factor in elephant dispersal. It monitored the vegetation structure and relative abundance of  species in remnant forest fragments in communal land areas (CLs) in the vicinity of  the Sengwa Wildlife Research Area (SWRA) and compared results with those from SWRA. Changes in woodlands with elephants are well documented, and although considered generalist feeders elephants  may be selective and therefore eliminate preferred woody species locally (Wing and Buss 1970; Anderson 1973;  Thomson 1975; Afolayan 1975; Jachmann and Bell 1979; Barnes 1983; Guy 1989).  The present study assessed canopy changes from 1966-1993 aerial photography, and species known to be preferred by elephants were monitored for 3 years in transects in the CLs.  Species differences can in part be attributed to high elephant densities,  fluctuations in numbers in the late 1970s when culling took place, and fire. At present  elephant are feeding primarily in the riverine valleys in the CLs, this provides for the least conflict with humans.  In the past elephant would have dispersed as food resources became depleted, this may be what is occurring as they move into remnant forest mosaics outside protected areas. Management must consider  effects of unchecked elephant population growth with reference to the removal of preferred tree species and  the motivation  of the animals to come in conflict with crops lands as they search for favoured indigenous species.

Les elephants Loxodonta africana dans la reserve de Biosphere de la Pendjari nord-est Republique du Benin: abondance, densite et repartition spatiale	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	33	64	68	Reviews the status of elephants (with reference to surveys in 1987, 1990, 2000-2002) in Pendjari Biosphere Reserve in northwest Benin and compares recent figures with the density and abundance in other protected areas in the immediate area (Arly, Pama, W Park).  Both aerial  and ground surveys have been undertaken and the populations observed and/or estimated vary  widely thus the author suggest that the ground survey counts in the central region (Pendjari NP) over the past three years be considered. However,  due to migration patterns, here too the counts very widely with 433, 428 and 2607 animals being observed in 2000, 2001 and 2002 respectively.  The author suggests counts and estimates should become more accurate as management capacity develops with the creation of a national centre for faunal reserves.	MRigby	pachy033.02.064.068.pdf

M.; Bitok, Elphas K.; Mayienda, Rose	Decline of elephants and other wildlife in the Nasolot-South Turkana and Kerio Valley-Kamnarok conservation areas, Kenya	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	33	69	73	The total aerial count of elephants (total counts for elephant and other wildlife, estimation for livestock numbers) in Nasolot, South Turkana, Kerio Valley and Kamnarok NRs undertaken  4-8 August, 2002 was flown over areas containing the largest elephant populations in western Kenya. The 490 elephant counted were largely present the northern portion of their range. This count showed significant  loss in numbers in recent years: a decline of 362 individuals or 42.4% since 1997 and 302 or 38.1% decline since 1999.  The distribution pattern during all three of these counts has been similar, most elephant  were observed in the northern and southern parts of the ecosystem. 62 skeletons (carcasses) were observed in  2002 compared to 45 in 1999 and 13 in 1997.  The carcass ratio of 11.2% was much higher than that in other elephant ranges in Kenya, and if it is considered to be a relative index of poaching levels, the illustrates an alarming situation. The estimated 29,000 head of livestock signify a high level of human activity and thus there is a high potential for human-wildlife conflict in this area.	MRigby	pachy033.02.069.073.pdf
Stiles, Daniel; Martin, Esmond Bradley	The trade in African and Asian ivory in South and South East Asia	Pachyderm	2002	Research and Review	33	74	90	In late 2000 and early 2001 the authors collected data on the numbers of retail outlets, ivory items, workshops, craftsmen, and the prices of raw and worked ivory in eight south and south east Asia countries: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and  Vietnam. This study serves as a  followup to their African review published in 2000.  Although all the nations studied except Laos are members of  CITES  and have domestic laws regarding ivory as well enforcement is weak, 'None of the governments for the countries surveyed have control over the ivory trade'.  However,  the ivory trade has declined since 1990, largely because the demand for ivory has generally been reduced, except for Thailand where it has probably remained about the same, and Myanmar where it has increased. Results indicate Thailand is the largest market and is fueled mainly by illegal imports of African raw ivory plus some tusks from Myanmar. The wholesale price of raw ivory was higher in 2001 than in the late 1980s and in 2001 the average tusk price in the Asian countries surveyed it was five times higher than in Africa (USD 250 versus USD 45).  The authors note 'It is important to stop the illegal ivory sale to tourists and businessmen in the two regions (a earlier reported focused on Africa) in order to reduce elephant poaching in Africa and Asia, especially Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam where wild elephant numbers have declined by over 75% since 1988'. The original reports for both Africa and Asia are in file (Martin and Stiles. 2000: Martin and Stiles 2002).	MRigby	pachy033.02.074.087.pdf
Maisels, Fiona G.; Blake, Stephen; Turkalo, Andrea K.	Wild forest elephants shake down fruit and leaves from trees	Pachyderm	2002	Field Notes	33	88	90	This short paper reviews aspects of observed feeding behaviour of forest elephants in  the vicinity Bomassa near of the headquarters of Nouabale-Ndoki NP, near  the  Dzanga Clearing and in Gamba.  These observations  suggest that 'forest elepants frequently manipulate both objects and inedible parts of food plants to obtain food as part of their behavioural repertoire'.  The assumption that forest elephant simply eat the fallen fruit is no longer valid, these observations note animals knocking fruit  down by throwing sticks, using branches to swipe at fruit and foliage, shake trees,  and push at trunks in order to bring down fruit. Night observations  in the vicinity Bomassa and assessment of the appearance of  the ground  around favoured food trees in other areas notes fruits from  trees such as Pseudospondias microcarpa, Myrianthus aboreus and Tetrapleura tetraptera, Omphalocarpum elatum and Chrysophyllum lacourteanum  are taken by either repeatedly shaking the trunks of the smaller trees or repeatedly pushing against the larger ones.  Near the Dzanga Clearing elephants have been heard and observed knocking fruit from additional tree species. Pygmies claim that elephants wait for fruit of certain trees to ripen and fall rather than attempt to gain quick access to the fruits by knocking them down. A film crew in Gamba noted elephant knocking Borassus aethiopum fruits down.	MRigby	pachy033.02.088.090.pdf

Update on the study and management of human-elephant conflict in Africa/ Mise en courant de l'etude et la gestion du conflit hommes-elephants en Afrique	Pachyderm	2002	Field Notes	33	91	92	Reviews focus and work of the Human-Elephant Conflict Working Group since its inception in 1996. Initial  identification and investigation of specific aspects of human-elephant conflict (HEC) problems  focused on management related outputs led to 'the production in 2001 of a 'decision support system' for managing conflicts'.  'A network of  AfESG collaborators' continues to contribute towards a growing understanding of  the HEC phenomenon which manifests itself in complex social and spatial dynamics across many bio-geographical landscapes in Africa. On the ground assessments have brought common characteristics and themes to bear on the application of  management  principles for  human and other wildlife conflicts  as well as those involving elephants. Thus 'HEC has become not a problem in isolation but a topic strongly linked to many fundamental conservation issues, especially community conservation initiatives'. Hoare  summarizes HEC knowledge in 10 points, four under human-elephant conflict plus 6 under other key points to keep in mind. The first set includes: the fact that HEC is widespread in Africa, and can be politically important on a local scale; it involves agricultural loss and social problems for affected people; it has complex spatial dynamics across the landscape; and the communitiy may perceive  quite differently than illustrated by gathered information.

Sikubwabo Kiyengo, Claude; Mubalama, Leonard Kakira	Les éléphants du Parc National des Virunga au travers la guerre en République Démocratique du Congo	Pachyderm	2003	Research and Review	34	45	52	Records suggest in 1959-1960 over 3000 elephant occupied the central portion of Virunga National Park during at least part of the year. By 2001 only about 400 animals might be present in this area. Large numbers of elephant were killed between 1964 and 1968, 1974 and 1984, and then again from 1996 to the time of reporting. The first and last dates are characterized by wars and insecurity, the second by high demand of ivory resulting from high prices on the international market. The authors suggest that as well as frequent war conditions, the government's relegation of conservation to a non-priority sector, insufficient operational capacity  in conservation agencies, and  the local population's ignorance of the status of elephants all acted against the elephants.  Animals in and around  protected areas such as Queen Elizabeth NP and Mgahinga Gorilla NP in Uganda and Parc National des Volcans in Rwanda  can play a role  repopulating the Virunga  area when conditions for them to range more widely become more positive.

Usongo, Leonard	Preliminary results on movements of a radio-collared elephant in Lobéké National Park, south-east Cameroon	Pachyderm	2003	Research and Review	34	53	58	Athough actual numbers and movements are unclear the south east region of  Cameroon  harbours a significant population of forest elephants. Preliminary results from data collected for 8 months from a 5 year old male forest elephant radio collared in March 2001 suggest that elephants spent more time in the forest in the logging concessions and professional hunting zones that they did in the Lobeke NP itself. Initial results from the telemetry programme, which was part of WWF's Jengi project, confirm the need to step up protection efforts including anti-poaching patrols to curb the poaching and illegal ivory trade opportunities that are common within the logging concessions. Further monitoring on radio collared elephant will assist in determining important corridors and migratory routes within the trans-boundary conservation programme region  involving contiguous protected areas in this region including the Dzanga-Sangha in  Central African Republic, and  Nouabale Ndoki NP in the Congo (where at least 3 elephant have been radio collared).

Nishihara, Tomo	Elephant poaching and ivory trafficking in African tropical forests with special reference to the Republic of Congo	Pachyderm	2003	Research and Review	34	66	74	"Elephant poaching is chronic and ivory is traded in and around Odzala NP in the Congo.  Larger pieces of ivory and more high-calibre weapons that had been seen for some time appeared in 1999 about the time the southern African countries legally exported ivory in a one off sale to Japan. However there have been no large scale slaughters reported since the 1997 one at Mouadje where 300 animals were killed. Laws are not enforced and Congolese authorities themselves are often involved in illegal activity. Several factors encourage elephant poaching including: widespread availability of military weapons,  local peoples' urge to profit from ivory sale; conflict between local people and conservation authorities over policies, and logging activities. 'The MIKE programme currently does not seem to function well in central Africa because of difficult logistics in the tropical forest and lack of experienced personnel.' The author suggests that  the driving force behind elephant poaching is the international demand for ivory, and in particular the Japanese demand for hard forest elephant ivory for name seals. He notes 'Allowing ivory trade, as adopted in the CITES... will encourage illegal traffic in hard ivory and stimulate more poaching of forest elephants'."	MRigby	pachy034.03.066.074.pdf

Demeke, Yirmed	Law enforcement, illegal activity and elephant status in Mago and Omo National Parks and adjacent areas, Ethiopia	Pachyderm	2003	Research and Review	35	16	30	A July to December 2002 projectfocused on monitoring the strength of law enforcement effort and the extent of illegal activity vis a vis wildlife also attempted to collect data on status of elephant populations on Omo and Mago NP's in southwest Ethiopia. The estimated elephant population in Mago NP is 200 animals: during the study elephant were observed 12 times in this area with one of those times being an observation of 167 animals. This estimation is 33% lower than the 1997/98 estimate, and it is considered that probably 48% of the Park may be occupied by elephant. Omo NP does not seem to have any permanent elephant populations, during the study elephant were only seen 3 times and one of these sightings involved a group of 327 animals. Due to budgetary constraints patrol staff is insufficent, and when arrests are made the penal system is very lax when dealing wildlife offenders. The authors full report is also in file.

Bhima, Roy; Howard, James; Nyanyale, Samuel	The status of elephants in Kasungu National Park, Malawi, in 2003	Pachyderm	2003	Research and Review	35	31	36	A dung count was used to assess the density of elephant in two separate areas (north, and central/southern) of the Kasungu NP, Malawi and attempted to determine the extent of elephant poaching and the steps needed to ensure protection of the remaining population.  Dung survey results suggest a population of 120-177 elephant occupies the southeastern portion of the Park. No elephant or recent signs of their presence were noted in the northern sector. This illustrates a significant population loss over the last two decades: 1975-1978 over 2000 elephant in Kasungu, 1992 approximately 900, 1996 about 321, and presently less than 200. (Jachmann and Bell 1978: Mkanda 1992, Bhima 1996). Poaching  is the prime cause of this loss. Reviews present guard numbers and workload as well as backgound of  law enforcement, and concludes that population loss will continue unless law enforcement activities are sufficiently increased to control poaching.

Hien, Bernard	Les elephants du Ranch de Gibier de Nazinga (Burkina Faso): donnees passes, situation actuelle, perspectives de conservation	Pachyderm	2003	Research and Review	35	43	52	Elephant frequenting the Nazinga Game Ranch were the focus of several studies during the 1980s, but little work was done during the past decade thus this study to assess  the present population in terms of  dynamics, seasonal distribution and habitat usage had much to catch up on. (Bousquet, 1982: Jachmann,1987, 1988 &1989: O'Donoghue, 1985)  It appears that the elephant numbers in the vicinity of the ranch are significantly less that during the 1980s: 87-230 in 2003 versus numbers tending to average around 300-600 during the 1980s. Human-elephant conflict or crop raiding and the continung fragmenting of habitat due to increasing human numbers and associated land use needs are the major problems regarding population loss. Poaching is common in the region, but relatively few elephant are poached although the observed animals exhibit both fear and aggressive behaviour towards humans, and their distribution appears to be inversely related to general poaching activity. Elephant move between the Ranch area and Kaboure Tambi NP to the north east, and also move between the Ranch and the Sissili GR bordering the Ranch on the west.  The elephant tend to go out of the Ranch area in the wet season and return in the dry season. Better security and conflict mitigation are both needed (Cornelis, 2000)	MRigby	pachy035.03.043.052.pdf

Osborn, Ferrel V.	Seasonal influence of rainfall and crops on home range expansion by bull elephants	Pachyderm	2003	Research and Review	35	53	60	'Knowledge of distribution and movement patterns in relation to their environment is essential if elephants are to be effectively managed because crop raiding is spatial and temporal in nature.'  This study attempted to obtain estimates of the home ranges of  elephants in Sengwa Wildlife Research Area, to establish seasonal crossing patterns into surrounding communal agricultural lands, and to examine the the concept of wet season range expansion. 7 adult and 3 subadult bulls were radio tracked during a two year period. 'Range sizes and crossing patterns out of the protected area were compared by season.' Results suggest that the concept of range expansion at the end of the wet season is correlated  with the movement of elephants into agricultural lands. Knowing how and when crop raiding elephants move into subsistence agricultural  areas that surround many of the protected areas is considered essential to identifying the reason why elephants and people come into conflict.

Ouattara, Soulemane	Determinisme des migrations des elephants de la Foret classee du Haut-Sassandra, Cote d'Ivoire	Pachyderm	2003	Research and Review	35	60	70	Discusses results stemming from October 1994-October 1996 research focused  on determining the factors affecting elephant migration in the Haut-Sassandra FR in the mid western region of Ivory Coast. This region has a long wet season extending from March through to October with the heaviest rains occuring near the beginning and the end  of the period, namely in April and September. The short dry season extends from November through February.  Density was ascertained from observation along ground transects.  Studies were done in the different areas frequented by elephants, and on the seasonal availability of food and water resources. Elephant  were present in both the north and south sector of  the area in the wet season, but were absent in the southern region during the dry season. They frequented the northern portion of the forest reserve year round, but were more numerous in the dry season because of the abundance of favoured fruit in  this region during this time. Migration was strongly related to the presence of fruit trees left standing after lumbering or as a component of the agricultural land use practises, and the availability of small water reserves within the forest.  Results suggest that elephants avoided areas with high human activity, particularly areas being logged or recently logged, or where hunting is being undertaken.

Litoroh, Moses W.	An elephant dung survey of the Shimba Hills ecosystem, Kenya	Pachyderm	2003	Research and Review	35	71	76	Results from a Sept 2002 dung survey of Shimba Hills NR in southeastern Kenya suggest a estimated number of elephants within the 250sq km area is 649+/-77, which is a density of 2.6 per sq km. Comparison of this number with previous surveys (453 in 1994, 475 in 1997, 523 in 1998, and 575 in 1999) suggests a  43% increase in the population in this fenced reserve over a 7 year period. The occurrence of dung piles in all stages of decay throughout the area suggests the elephants are well distributed. However, the author states 'although the area outwardly appears to be flourishing, the habitat is under intense pressure from the elephants. Research notes the overall diversity of plant species has declined, and the habitat is degraded due to changes in plant community structure. (Litoroh, et al. 2001: Mwathe. 1995)  Previous studies noted the need to protect biodiversity in this ecosystem (Holf & Holf. 1995). The human elephant conflict which lessened after  the 120 km fence enclosing the Reserve was completed in mid 1990s is resurfacing as the fence, for various technical reasons, is failing  to contain the raising elephant population. Management options are tersely reviewed: culling (not acceptable in Kenya), elephant drives (forced movement which would be difficult to handle), space winning (not feasible for an area surrounded by agricultural  land), fertility regulation (a feasible alternative for the long term , but not yet technically feasible), and translocation (short term, but the most feasible alternative at the present). 29 elephant were translocated from the Mwaluganje Elephant Sanctuary sector of the ecosystem in 1999. Recommends 200 elephant be moved from Shimba to Tsavo NP as soon as funding is secured.	MRigby	pachy035.03.071.076.pdf

The elephant were anaesthesized with a mixture of etorphine HCI (M99) and hyaluronidase. Drug monitoring records were assessed according to three age groups adults, subadults, and juveniles.   Darting of the adults and subadults was done from a helicopter while the calves were darted from ground level. 'Results of this study show that most physiologic parameters are different in the 3 age groups of elephants.  Respiratory rate and pulse rate was significantly different between adults and juvenile and between juveniles and  subadults with the juveniles having the highest and the adults the lowest as is also the case in body temperature.  'This is attributed to the high metabolic rate in young animals'.  Mean corpuscular value and haemoglobin were highest in adults and lowest in juveniles while white blood cells count was significantly higher in juveniles than in adults. 'The range for haematological parameters compared well with those reported by other authors except for the white blood cell counts', but actual data is difficult to compare because other authors rarely recorded the age groups separately.

Stiles, Daniel; Martin, Esmond Bradley	The trade in African and Asian ivory in East Asia	Pachyderm	2003	Research and Review	35	99	99	This paper summarizes material presented in the reports on the ivory trade in Asia recently compiled by the two authors. (Martin & Stiles. 2002, 2003)  They  note that there is a positive correlation between elephant poaching and ivory demand, and that East Asia is the main destination of illegal ivory from Africa.  They suggest the scale of ivory markets in East Asia 'gives an indication of the degree of the demand for ivory, and therefore of the level of  elephant killing needed to supply that demand'.  In 2002 Hong Kong displayed by far the most worked ivory for sale, but China has emerged as the largest illegal manufacturer and importer-exporter of ivory, most of it of  African origin.  They note that Japan remains a relatively important market although the industry 'has declined considerably since 1990' and that most of Japan's ivory production is bought by Japanese and remains in the country, while most of China's ivory production is exported. The authors conclude 'Ivory law-enforcement efforts are improving in the region, but much more remains to be done to control illegal movement and the sale of ivory'.	MRigby	pachy035.03.099.099.pdf

The authors conclude ' that the conditions and flawed since they do not allow for verification of trade controls in exporting countries or implementation of recommendations to improve law enforcement coordination', and that trade controls in prospective importing countries 'particularly Japan'  are inadequate. They state 'Detailed guidelines on standarized controls are needed, on the the basis of which it is proposed that an independent review team verifies compliance'.  The authors note the assessment  the Monitoring Illegal Killing of  Elephants (MIKE) programme needs more time as does the linking of the MIKE with the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) programme so baseline data can be collected on elephant populations, poaching and illegal trade. Concludes that the time needed for baseline data collection 'precludes any ivory trade before 2005' and suggests this horizon could be pushed significantly further into the future.

The Society organized one month long course for 12 wildlife and forestry students from Kwame Nkrumah Universite: 2 weeks of theory given in Ankasa Conservation Area  followed by 2 weeks of field work focused on a survey of elephant in the Dadieso and Disne River Forest Reserves. A table 'Topics covered in the Training Course for Wildlife Managers' outlines the topics covered, the skills taught and developed, and the emphasis given to aspects of the training topics. 'The course was designed to provide a continental overview of the status of elephants, problems of elephant management and human-elephant conflict, the biology of elephant populations and individuals, and census methods.'  During the fieldwork phase 'the standard transect-line method (Buckland et al. 1993) was used to survey elephants and other animals on 45 1-km transects. Questionnnaries were administered in 14 randonly selected villages within 7 kms of the reserves'.  The authors note that it will take some time to fully evaluate the results of the training, but they list several benefits already evident over the five months subsequent to the course including: the participants increased capability to plan/develop, execute, and report on projects undertaken since the training; their increased understanding of analytical skills; and, the confidence to work as a fully participating member of a research team on other programmes.

This article reviews the populations loss of buffalo, rhino and elephant in Garamba NP and adjacent reserves of Azande, Gangala na Bodio and Mondo Missa in northwestern DRC in three phases: 1991-1997, 1997-2003 and late June 2003 to the present (journal published in January 2004).  In 1991 when some 80000 Sudanese refugees settled in the vicinity of Garamba meat from bufflalo became their major protein source. In 1993 the majority of the poaching still occurred in the north and central regions of the Park , but by 1997 during  DRC's own civil war poaching had moved into the southern sector. The civil war precipitated poaching and certainly not only for meat. In 1997 alone it is considered that the elephant population was halved (11175 +/-3670 to 5874+/-1339). By 1999 the southern sector was the focus for poaching. 'Since June 2003 poaching in Garamba NP has changed from meat to ivory. The level of poaching of elephants has exploded '. In August an aerial survey noted 34 fresh elephant carcasses while a November survey observed 27 fresh and recent carcasses plus 7 additional old ones. Most of the poachers are well armed Sudanese military and military deserters. Guards trained and supported through the internationally funded Garamba National Park Project and its core expatriate staff  focus on protecting the few remaining rhino and the elephant  population in the southern sector.

Mubalama, Leonard Kakira; Mushenzi, Norbert	Monitoring law enforcement and illegal activities in the northern sector of the Parc National des Virunga, Democratic Republic of Congo	Pachyderm	2004	Research and Review	36	16	29	This paper focuses on a year long (July 2002-July 2003) law-enforcement monitoring  project  in the northern sector of Parc National des Virunga (PNVi), which 'made a preliminary study of the background affecting elephant poaching and other illegal activities by using a state-of-the-art geographic information system (GIS)'. With recent data suggesting 'that is it not deforestation but defaunation that poses the greatest immediate threat to animal conservation' this study assessed the utility of both the conventional  deterrence involving routine foot patrols within the study area associated with boundary checks and visits to neighbouring villages, as well as investigation operations following up information supplied through a network of informants outside the area. It appears that when effectively implemented these two operations are equally important in deterring wildlife offenders.  The authors note 'that increased effectiveness in anti-poaching can be achieved only by appropriate law enforcement as a deterrent by providing information that site managers can use to determine how to allocate resources optimally to improve protection and management of elephants and other wildlife'. Although this study was carried out in an area that continues to suffer the consequences of a lengthy civil war  this study suggests conservation measures based on deterrence can be implemented under precarious political conditions. Mubalama presented this article as the paper 'Monitoring of law enforcement and illegal activity in the northern sector of the Parc National des Virunga under siege with a focus on elephant (Loxodonta africana) poaching' during the 6th AFESG Meeting at Mokuti Lodge, Namibia, Dec 4-8, 2003.

de Iongh, Hans H.; Tchamba, Martin N.; Aarhaug, Per; Verhage, Bas	Impact of dam construction on two elephant populations in northern Cameroon	Pachyderm	2004	Research and Review	36	30	43	Construction of dams in northern Cameroon, the Maga Dam in the vicinity of Waza NP in 1979 and the Ladgo Dam in the vicinity of Bouba-Ndjidda, Benoue and Faro NPs  in 1980 had profound effects on elephant populations in the northern  Cameroon. The elephant populations in both areas increased rather dramatically and increased crop raiding has been a pattern in both areas. This article reviews data from 1994-2002 studies, focused on seasonal movement of  the elephants and crop raiding  problems.  In 1978 the dry season elephant population in Waza NP was estimated at 465 animals, in 2001 the estimation was 1140. In the Lagdo area there were no elephants resident during the dry season prior to construction of the dam - twenty years later, in 2000 about 250-300 animals are in the area.  The Waza elephant have undergone more scrutiny as they have been  studied since 1986, but the Ladgo population has been observed only since 1995.  3 adults in each area (3 cows in Waza 1993,1994 and 1996: 1bull and 2 cows in Ladgo 2000) were radio collared in order to study movement, home range and habitat use by the subpopulations.  Data suggest the home range of the Waza populations to be about 2546 sq kms while that of those in the Ladgo area is significantly less, about 119 sq kms.  Dam construction in in the Waza area resulted in severe deterioration of the perennial floodplain vegetation between 1980-1994, and  the Waza elephants showed seasonal migration to an area over 100 km south of the Park where they caused significant crop damage.  After the floodplain was artificially reflooded in 1994  they did not alter this pattern of movement, but shifted their dry season habitat in the park  from the Acacia savannah zone to the floodplain.  The Ladgo elephant have consistently spend more time in the floodplain area, as their habitat did not deteriorate after the dam was constructed.  (Saleh, et al., 2002. de Iongh, et al, 1999). This article was given aa a paper 'Impact of dam construction on two elephant populations in Northern Cameroon' at the 6th AfESG meeting at Mokuti Lodge, Namibia, 4-8 December 2003.

McKnight, Barbara L.	Elephant numbers, group structure and movements on privately owned land adjacent to Tsavo East National Park, Kenya	Pachyderm	2004	Research and Review	36	44	51	This July 1999-Nov 2001 study, which focused on the elephants in the Rukinga Wildlife Sanctuary and Taita Ranch lying between West Tsavo and the southwest boundary of Tsavo East in the southern sector of  the Tsavo ecosystem, attempted to ascertain the number of elephants, and their group sizes and structure at the population level, and to identify individuals to facilitate further research on demography and ranging behaviour at the individual level. A photographic identification file for 165 animals was compiled. The number of elephants sighted per month ranged from 65 to 292 and almost half the sightings were groups of bulls or lone bulls.  Resightings were relatively low, only 37.5% of the bulls and 60.5 % of the cows were seen in the area more than once which suggests that this area is a portion of a much larger range. 14 (6 lone bulls and 2 family groups of the elephant sighted were known to have moved between the National Park and private land and to do so crossed a major highway and railway, which illustrates that the long time routes continue to be tranversed. Elephants are getting caught up in snares intended  for smaller 9 animals (used for bushmeat) and may be harassed or killed due largely to conflict with herdsmen over access to water: Nine known adults had tips or sections of the trunk missing, two had deep slash wounds across the trunk, one had a snare embedded around the trunk, two had snares embedded around the leg and two died from poisoned arrow.'  This particular study augments ongoing research in the Tsavo ecosystem. (McKnight, 1995, 1996, 2000)	MRigby	pachy036.04.044.051.pdf
Shoshani, Jeheskel; Hagos, Yohannes; Yacob, Yohannes I.; Ghebrehiwet, Medhanie; Kebrom, Emun	Elephants (Loxodonta africana) of Zoba Gash Barka, Eritrea: Part 2. Numbers and distribution, ecology and behaviour, and fauna and flora in their ecosystem	Pachyderm	2004	Research and Review	36	52	68	This second article in Pachyderm focuses on the ecology and habitat utilization of elephants presently occupying the Gash Barka  [Zoba Gash Barka] area of south western Ertirea based on field data collected during 2001-2003. (Shoshani et al., 2003)  Animals of all ages were observed in the population of about 100 animals, which during the dry season occupy the Gash and Setit River valleys in Gash Barka  region. These elephant migrate to northern Ethiopia during the dry season.  Data suggests the elephant play a keystone role in the ecology of this area, and the authors note : 'It appears that a symbiotic relationship exists between elephants and doum palms and between elephants and baboons, and a commensal relationship may exist between elephants and helmeted guinea fowls'.  The authors note: 'We started a new method using soleprints as a possible character for reliably identifying individual elephants.'	MRigby	pachy036.04.052.068.pdf
Okoumassou, Kotchikpa; Durlot, Sophie; Akpamou, Kokouvi G.; Segniagbeto, Hoinsounde	Impacts humains sur les aires de distribution et couloirs de migration des elephants au Togo	Pachyderm	2004	Research and Review	36	69	79	This 2002-2003 two phase study focused on Togo's present elephant populations.  Initially researchers attended and asked questions at 40 meetings in 34 villages located in areas affected  by elephant migration and/or crop raiding. Discussion focused on the present distribution and migratory routes, and the locations and types of human/elephant conflicts. The second phase focused on counting animals in the populations and identifying migratory routes, GPS equipment was utilized during a ground survey assessment. Elephants occur in two areas: the central area where they are permanently present in Fazao-Malfakassa NP and Abdoulaye R (may be considered seasonal) and eastward into Benin; and the northern savannah region where they are seasonly present in Doungh F adjacent to the Ghana border, Fosse aux Lions NP and southward into Galangashie R and Keran NP. Migratory routes generally follow river valleys in this region, which experiences two seasons per annum, a long dry season from October to April and and shorter wet season from April to September, although rainfall in southern (Central area) range is sufficient for year round water supply. 'Three groups of elephants have been observed in Fazao-Malfakassa NP and fresh trails were seen in Abdoulaye R'. Significant human/elephant conflicts occur along the migration routes and as human populations and associated agricultural needs and deforestation continue conflicts will rise. 'An evaluation of the elephant conservation measures in use shows obvious shortcomings in both the competence of wildlife administrators and in management of the animals'.

Managing human-elephant conflicts: the Kenyan experience	Pachyderm	2004	Research and Review	36	80	86	This paper reviews the increasing human/elephant conflict situation in Kenya, which is largely due to the fact that elephant habitats have been 'fragmented and reduced'. The authors note: 'If the two are to co-exist, conflicts must be minimized by decreasing the costs and increasing the benefits that come to the local communities as they interact with wildlife'. Strategies used in attempts to mitigate conflict include: electric fencing and  other physical barriers such as vegetation and stone walls, problem animal control, drives or attempts to force the animals to move out the area,  translocation, establishment of sanctuaries.

Whyte, Ian J.	Ecological basis of the new elephant management policy for Kruger National Park and expected outcomes	Pachyderm	2004	Policy	36	99	108	The maintenence of  Kruger NP's indigenous biodiversity is the focus of  the management policy which has evolved since the 1995 moratorium on culling the resident elephant population was put in place.  This 'Managing for maximum biodiversity will be achieved through principles outlined in the 'intermediate disturbance hypothesis'  and by inducting elephant populations fluctuations, which is is believed will also play an important role.'  To implement the programme Kruger NP was divided into 6 zones which were based on research on elephant clan movements. Two small botanical reserves in which medium elephant densities will be maintained are located in the northern and southern extremes of the Park. The remainder  is divided into four larger similar sized areas.  Two are low-elephant-impact where elephant densities will be actively reduced through management, and the other two are high-elephant-impact zones where no population control will be conducted. At a point in future when the biodiversity monitoring programmes indicate that acceptable thresholds of change have been reached or exceeded the management option for the low and high elephant impact zones will be reversed.

Coprophagy and unusual thermoregulatory behaviour in desert-dwelling elephants of north-western Namibia	Pachyderm	2004	Field Notes	36	113	115	During monitoring studies on the elephant population in the ephemeral river valleys in northwestern Namibia researchers observed instances of coprophagy by young animals and attempts to control thermoregulation on the part of both adults and juveniles.  In three cases juvenile or young mature elephant were observed ingesting unusually loose textured freshly excreted dung of older elephants. Under hot dry conditions adult animals were observed withdrawing water from their  pharyngeal pouches and spraying it on their backs and behind their ears. Juveniles were seen scooping up sand, which adults has just urinated on, with their trunks and throwing/tossing it on their backs and bodies in apparent attempts to cool themselves.

Hunter, Nigel; Martin, Esmond Bradley; Milliken, Tom	Determining the number of elephants required to supply current unregulated ivory markets in Africa and Asia	Pachyderm	2004	Working paper	36	116	128	Athough several recent reports have been focused on the relationship between unregulated ivory markets and illicit trade in ivory in Africa and Asia the authors note there has been no clear indication of  'the number of elephants that are required annually to service these markets, and the geographical regions from which these elephants are being taken'.  Data in reports on the ivory markets provided enough information to estimate the number of carvers and to 'extrapolate these data to derive minimum and maximum estimations of ivory consumption in 25 key countries around the world'.   The authors note 'This makes it possible to estimate minimum and maximum values for  the number of elephants required to support these ivory-carving industries'. It appears that about 4000 elephant or more are required each year to support the overall industry, and preliminary information suggests that the supply for the unregulated markets in both continents is coming from elephant populations in central Africa.  The authors note 'unregulated ivory markets in Africa appear to consume a higher volume of ivory than those in Asia'.  This paper is based on preliminary assessments and it is hoped that analysis will build 'MIKE and ETIS links'.(Blanc, et al., 2003: Courouble, et al., 2003: Dublin, et al., 1995: Martin & Stiles 2000,2002,2003: Stiles &Martin 2001: Milliken, et al., 2002)	MRigby	pachy036.04.116.128.pdf
Hunter, Nigel; Milliken, Tom	Clarifying MIKE and ETIS	Pachyderm	2004	Letters	36	129	132	This article is a rebuttal to Reeves, et al. which was written as an opinion article in Pachyderm 35. (Reeves, et al. 2003) The authors note that it was the Conference of the Parties at CoP10 which set out the conditions regarding one-off sales of ivory and that the Standing Committee had no power to alter such decisions. They state  'The decision to develop a monitoring system to track illegal killing of elephants in the field was intitated by the African range states and agreed by CITES Parties at CoP10 in Resolution Conf.10.10'.  The authors, who are both directly involved in the development and operative aspects of MIKE and ETIS, use this article to review their implementation. 'MIKE uses a statistical approach to look at relationships between  the illegal killing of elephants and various possible explantory features', while 'ETIS is a comprehensive information system to track illegal trade in ivory and other elephant products. '  The authors suggest that Reeves et al., should have allowed for greater differentiation between criticism of MIKE and ETIS and that ETIS was functioning sufficiently well by CoP12 to allow for the decision for the one-off sales, but they do acknowledge that more time is needed for MIKE to be fully operational.

Report: Sixth meeting of the African Elephant Specialist Group	Pachyderm	2004	Meeting proceedings	36	136	139	Reviews the sixth meeting of the AfESG,which was attended by 34 of the 48 members, held December 4-8, 2003 at Mokuti Lodge on the edge of Etosha NP in northern Namibia. Several papers presented at meeting are in this issue of Pachyderm and others will appear in following issues.  Five topics covered during the meetings are discuss: multiple species of African elephant, listing of the African elephant in the IUCN Red List, wild sourcing of African elephants for captivity,  effect a stategy for assessing the future of the African elephant, and review approach to managing local overpopulation.  The participants reviewed the discussion focused on multiple species of the African elephant which took place during of the fifth members meeting in Shaba  and the text on the website resulting in a revised text now on the website: http://iucn.org/afesg. A temporary taskforce for was struck to look at how the African elephant fits into the IUCN Red List version 3.1 . Discussion on the wild sourcing of Africa elephants for captivity led to a decision that no direct benefit to en situ conservation occurs when this is done, and AfESG does not endorse this activity - a statement to this effect in now on the website. An interesting component of this meeting involved strategic thinking focused on a scenario planning  approach to the conservation of African elephant on a continental basis - further analysis via subregioanl workshops focused on this analysis will be forthcoming.  The problem of local overpopulations is one for which alternatives need to be assesed and to this end a Local Population Task Force will be struck and begin working in May 2004.

Garaï, Marion E.; Slotow, Rob; Carr, Richard D.; Reilly, Brian K.	Elephant reintroductions to small fenced reserves in South Africa	Pachyderm	2004	Research and Review	37	28	36	This article focuses 'on the question of whether the translocation of elephants can be termed successful according to the short-term indicators of natural reproduction, mortality rate and population growth'.  It is based on data collected by the EMOA over the past decade, and particularly on information obtained by the 2001 questionnnaire which served as the base for a database tracking these aspects.  Between 1979 and 2001 over 800 elephant were reintroduced, largely from Kruger NP,  to 46 government and 12 private reserves in South Africa. Most of these areas lie within four regions:  Zululand in KwaZulu Natal; Waterberg and Hoedspruit in Limpopo, and in the Eastern Cape. The number of animals introduced at any one time varied widely, from 2 to 227. Over half (56%) adult females that were transferred gave birth within 2 years and so were pregnant at the time of capture. 38 of  the reserves (68%) have shown an increase greater than 10% of the initial populations,  16 have shown no change, however most of these have held the reintroduced animals for less than 5 years, and two, which were given only  young orphaned animals have shown a loss. When young orphaned animals, which because of technology available in the earlier years were the initial founder populations, were transferred on their own, morality was relatively high (185of 225 animals) but it has decreased substantially since complete family groups have been moved. The authors note this analysis confirms the short-term success of  establishing elephant in relatively small fenced reserve.  However, the health and welfare of such herds in the long terms is yet to be determined and there have been a number of behavioural problems particualry those linked to disrupted social structure which need to be studied further and taken into account in management. Garai's paper 'History and populations of the re-introduced elephants in samll fenced reserves in South Africa' given at the 6th AfESG meeting in Mokuti Lodge, Namibia, December 4-8, 2003 was based on this article and  one in preparation by Slotow and others, focused on population ecology of elephant in small fenced reserves.

Osborn, Ferrel V.	The concept of home range in relation to elephants in Africa	Pachyderm	2004	Research and Review	37	37	44	The article outlines the concept of home range, compares different methods that have been used to determine ranges and discusses their relevance to elephant ecology. After reviewing  earlier works on the concept the author focuses on core areas and reviews four methods of assessing the structure of core areas: minimum convex polygon, harmonic mean, cluster and kernel.  'Rainfall is used as a variable across elephant habitats to explain range variation' and the author  uses Table 2 to illustrate a comparison of  the size of  the range, the number of elephants (in the study area), and the rainfall in mm  in various ecosystems across the continent. He notes that humans have impacted on the pattern of elephant range and that elephants wherever possible tend to avoid areas of  illegal hunting and human settlements. Concludes it is important to understand core areas and to link their relevance to elephant conservation, and to appreciate that rainfall is basic to the difference in range size, but that human activity is playing and ever increasingly important role.

Yacob, Yohannes I.; Shoshani, Jeheskel; Hagos, Yohannes; Kebrom, Emun	The elephants (Loxodonta africana) of Zoba Gash Barka, Eritrea: Part 3. Ecological and other data from tusks, teeth and carcasses	Pachyderm	2004	Research and Review	37	45	58	An isolated elephant population of about 100 animals live in the border region of northwestern Ethiopia and southwestern Eritrea.  During the October-February dry season these elephant migrate to Eritrea and return southward to Ethiopia at the beginning of the short wet season. (Hagos, et al. 2003: Shoshani, et al. 2004) During dry period the only natural occuring  permanent open water may be the Setit (Tekezze) River which forms the border between the two countiries. This article, the third of a series, 'summarizes nine years of ecological data retrieved from tusks and three years of data from dead elephants'.  Body measurements and pathological data were taken from 11 elephants which were found dead between 2002 and 2004: four had fallen into manmade water wells,  two were killed by farmers, and 'five died form unknown causes although some exhibited pathological bones and teeth.'  Table 1 reviews  information on the recently dead elephants while Table 2 reviews data (lengths, circumferences, weight, etc) from the 31 tusks collected since 1993. The authors note their observations confirm that a healthy elephant population inhabits the southwestern region of Eritrea duirng the long dry season. However, over the past three years it has suffered a loss of about 5% per annum, and this loss is in part due to attempts to drink from manmade wells because of the lack of  natural water sources. Recommends artificial water sites, constructed so that young elephants could access them easily, be installed 'along the path of elephant movement. Calls for the establishment of protected areas because as this population increases the conflict with the human populations will become greater and more contentious land use issues will arise.

Chemical composition of mineral licks used by elephants in Aberdares National Park, Kenya	Pachyderm	2004	Research and Review	37	59	67	This July-August 2002 study assessed the physical and chemical properties of  14  natural mineral licks and their use by African elephants in Aberdare NP in Central Kenya and recorded the elephant use of  2 artificial salt licks, in the same Park,  for 15 days. The mineral licks were postioned by GPS and classified according to extend of  present use: light, moderate, heavy and abandoned.  A total of 56 samples were taken from the mineral licks and 52 control samples were taken from locations about 200m away each of the licks. The mineral licks or 'eaten earths differed from the uneaten earths primarily in their significantly higher sodium and iodine concentrations'.  The mineral lick samples contained a higher clay content than did the control samples.  'This work therefore isolated sodium iodine and clay content as the possible stimuli for geophagy among the elephants' in this area.  The authors note: 'Sodium preference could be attributed to palatability, clay has a possible medicinal function and also retards leaching of sodium and iodine.  It appears elephant seek  inorganic sources to supplement  iodine well as sodium and it would be important to assess licks for both elements in areas where range is becoming more restricted as the animals may not be able to access mineralized soils areas they used to.  The age and sex of the animals using two artifical salt licks in the vicinity of tourist hotels were recorded over a 15 day period.	MRigby	pachy037.04.059.067.pdf
Boafo, Yaw; Dubiure, Umaru Farouk; Danquah, Emmanuel K. A.; Manford, Mildred Appiah; Nandjui, Awo; Hema, Emmanuel M.; Barnes, Richard F. W.; Bailey, Brent	Long-term management of crop raiding by elephants around Kakum Conservation Area in southern Ghana	Pachyderm	2004	Opinion	37	68	72	In April 2000 Manager of the Kakum Conservation Area and members of the Elephant Biology & Management Team (EBM) took part in a workshop focused on crop raiding. The priority need appeared to be identifying the causes of the problem and on this basis the EBM team established a random sample set study site and monitored losses during the 2001 and 2002 crop-growing seasons. Analysis of  the apparent rise in crop raiding during recent seasons suggest that it is a symptom of  the changes in the landscape over the past century. Ghana's human population grew dramatically, the forest has progressively been replaced by farms and farmbush, and logging has also been responsible for forest lost. Cultivated fields  have come very close to the park boundary and are therefore more vulnerable to crop raiding. The study team proposed  'a triple-pronged strategy of landscape management, crop raiding detection and elephant replusion, to reduce the risk of crop damage around the KCA' . Recommended a task force consisting of officers from government wildlife, agriculture and forestry sectors be struck and charged with working with farming communities, district assemblies, traditional chiefs and the local religious institutions to implement the strategy. Landscape management will be handled via a zoning system with no food crops grown within the first km around the park, and within the one to two km zone only a few crops should be grown. A system of for detecting the animals should be put in place, farmers must become more protective of their crops and alert about the presence of  elephants and strive to learn the most appropriate deterrent techniques for driving them away. 'The idea that protected areas can be managed as islands is now obsolete',suggests that the KCA must be understood as a component of the regional landscape and managed as such.

Bouché, Philippe; Lungren, Clark G.	Les petites populations d'éléphants du Burkina Faso: statut, distribution et déplacements	Pachyderm	2004	Field Notes	37	84	91	This paper reviews the status of  several small populations of elephants, representing a total population of 225-230, occupying ranges and corridor areas in Burkina Faso itself, and border regions between Burkina Faso and Togo, Ghana and Ivory Coast in the south, and Burkina Faso and Mali in the north.  A table reviews the estimated  number of animals and location of 10 of  these small populations. They range form about 100 in the Zahre-Red Volta region in northwest Ghana and border area of  Burkina Faso border, to about 60 in the Bontioli, Nabere, Mou, and Comoe Valley region  in the vicinity of the Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast border, to about 26 in the Diefoula  area  further west along this same border plus several populations containing less than 10 animals. Map 1 which outlines the general situation and shows the general range areas and major corridors of movement is augmented by three additional maps which focus on specific regions showing  ranges and corridor areas in more detail.  Although the numerical importance of these small elephant populations appears low at the continental level it is high on the subregional level.  Their effect at the local level, whether is be in terms of crop raiding, tourism or potential human-elephant land use needs to be studied and recent aerial surveys of the WAPOK and PONASI ecosystems illustrate a beginning towards this need.

Site selection  was restricted to those in which successive survey estimates had been made using comparable methods. Selected areas are in east and southern Africa where surveys were conducted between 1994 and 2002, and  as a whole cover a large percentage of the total elephant population.  Results suggest a significant overall increase (p<0.0002) for the eastern and southern African sites combined. The combined area of the chosen surveys represents 21% of the known  possible elephant range for eastern Africa and 23% for southern Africa, but only 11% of the total presently known for the continent. However, the estimated number of elephants in these sites represents about 77% of the total known continental population. The overall increase in the southern African estimate was significant (p<0.0004), but the increase in eastern African estimates was not statistically significant. 'It is concluded that savanna elephant populations in eastern and southern Africa are more likely to have increased than to have declined in the years leading up to the African Elephant Status Report 2002'. The authors note 'however, these data should be interpreted with care'.	MRigby	pachy038.05.019.028.pdf
Malima, Cyprian; Hoare, Richard E.; Blanc, J. Julian	Systematic recording of human-elephant conflict: a case study in south-eastern Tanzania	Pachyderm	2005	Research and Review	38	29	38	A standardized data collection system devised to record and assess human-elephant conflict was used in subsistence agricultural  areas to the east of  Selous GR in Tanzania.  'Nine enumerators were recruited, trained and supervised to collect primary data on elephant damage incidents in 38 rural villages widely spaced throughout an area of  30000sq km. Reviews results from the first year  (July 2003-June 2004) of a proposed three year study. 1239 incidents occurred of which 973 were assessed as crop raiding.  Sixteen categories of food crops were damaged, representing loss to both wet and dry season produce.  Mixed herds were the most common raiders in both wet and dry seasons (56% and 63% respectively),  lone bulls were second  (22%) in the wet season, with bull groups (22%) playing this role in the dry season.  Elephants killed 2 people, and people killed 25 elephants. Initial study year  results already serve to illustrate the utility and cost-effectiveness of simple, inexpensive recording schemes, operated principally by people within affected communities and producing rapid results relevant to local wildlife management and community-based observation. The authors note results from the initial year of the project 'have successfully tested the principle and logistics of collecting primary data through an independent third party', in this case the village level enumerators, 'rather than from affected people's verbal accounts or from employees of a national wildlife authority'. In both these latter cases data are often inconsistent or biased. (Hoare, 2001) The authors conclude that the study probably operated over the largest area ever covered by a wildlife conflict reporting scheme of its kind. In much of the area villages are widely spaced and the proportion of the area actually occupied and cultivated is very small  (1%) making the probability of human-elephant conflict slight.

Adjewodah, Patrick; Beier, Paul; Kofi Sam, Moses; Mason, John J.	Elephant crop damage in the Red Volta Valley, north-eastern Ghana	Pachyderm	2005	Research and Review	38	39	48	Crop raiding behaviour of elephants that seasonally migrate into the Red Volta Valley was monitored as part of a project assessing conflict mitigation.  Betrween 1999-2003  farmers in the project area were organized into associations. Whenever crops of the registered farmers were raided by elephant the field location and size, the area of the field damaged, the crops grown and the date of the damage were recorded.  2-3% of the farmers were affected by raiding elephants annually. In 2002 the damaged area per farm averaged .98 ha. The time period with the highest raiding incidents was the preharvest and harvest  August - November period, which coincides with the time that elephants migrate into the study area from from Burkina Faso.  The geographical pattern of destruction mirrored the sequence of the migration, and those most affected were located along the route in the Red Volta valley forest area.  Planting alternative crops that mature prior to the migration  period is advisable as is locating feilds away from the forest reserves.	MRigby	pachy038.05.039.048.pdf
Kofi Sam, Moses; Danquah, Emmanuel K. A.; Oppong, Samuel K.; Ashie, Enoch A.	Nature and extent of human-elephant conflict in Bia Conservation Area, Ghana	Pachyderm	2005	Research and Review	38	49	58	During the 2004 rainy season the nature and extent of  human-elephant conflict focused on crop raiding and damage was investigated in and around Bia Conservation Area (comprised of two forest areas  Bia NP and Bia Resource Reserve to the south of the Park).  49 elephant crop raiding incidents involving 44 farms belonging to 36 farmers from 18 villages were recorded during the study period.  Questionnaire based interviews were undertaken with 42 randomly selected members of 11 randomly selected fringe communities of the 20 major communities witin 7 kms of the Conservation Area boundary. Information on the current crop damage was collected within 48 hours of the incident: field location, size, crop type and growth stage, extent of damage  were recorded.  Severe crop damage starts in June and increases until peaking in September/October and then declines until becoming minimal in December. The majority of interviewees (72%) were new immigants to the area, and had no idea about the relative number of elephants in the area. Over 90% employed some kind of traditional deterrent for driving the elephants away. Based on visual and track identification it appeared that at least 24 male and 12 female elephant were involved in the raiding incidents. In term of age 43 adults and 33 subadults and infants were seen on different occasions.  Elephant crop raiding dates to the 1970s when immigrants came to the area and began farming in close proximity to the reserves. It has increased,  now family groups as well as bulls raid, raiding occurs anytime of the day and throughout the year, although it is most prevalent in the wet season here as it is in Kakum CA.  Farmers should be encouraged to protect their crops. However, elephants habituate to many scare techniques, farmers must constantly assess the risk involved  including planting fields far from areas frequented by migrating elephant.

Obot, Emmanuel; Edet, Clement; Ogar, Gabriel; Ayuk, Joy	Population  survey of elephants in Okwangwo Division, Cross River National Park, Nigeria	Pachyderm	2005	Research and Review	38	59	63	A elephant  census based on dung counts along five trails, with a total length of 139 kms, was undertaken March 1997-May 1998 in Cross River NP, Nigeria.  'There appears to be a seasonal local migration of this population between Cross River NP and the neighbouring Takamanda FR in Cameroon: the elephants spend most of the rainy season in Cameroon and the dry season in Cross river NP.'  Within the park elephants seem to occupy a home range of about 239 sq km, from Okwangwo in the centre of the park through Bamba on the eastern boundary to Bashu on the south, and dung count analysis suggests 74 animals in this area.  This study indicates 50 to 130 elephant are in the area,  and interviews with hunters suggest there are about 10 groups of  around 15 animals per group.  This latter figure suggests 150 animals in total which compares favourably with the study maximum estimate of 130. Authors note poaching for ivory and meat was excessive before the park was gazetted in 1991, and antipoaching activities must be maintained if any population  is to survive.

Fischer, Frauke	Elephants in Côte d'Ivoire - a warning for West African conservation	Pachyderm	2005	Research and Review	38	64	75	As its name implies Ivory Coast probably maintained one of the largest elephant populations in West Africa at the time of early European contact. Today its population occurs in small isolated enclaves. While the ivory trade did cause heavy losses at its peak it is the destruction of their habitat which has been  largly responsible for the drop in elephant numbers over the past decade.  'Major elephant habitats in forest (Tai NP) and savanna (Comoe NP) remain intact, but potential immigration from other sites or even re-introduction of elephants would require significant improvement in park management and nature conservation'.  Author suggests that at present Ivory Coast holds only seven confirmed elephant populations totally about 270 animals and does not think any populations exist outside protected areas.  As late as 1997 Comoe NP may have held around 120 elephants, but since 1998 direct observations have been rare. After 1999 a few sightings in the vicinity of the village of Gorowi near the southern part of the park  noted 11-15 animals.  Human-elephant conflicts were reported in the vicinity of Marahoue NP during the late 1990s, and  in July 2002 the MIKE team estimated about 160 were in the area.  Recently the Tai NP elephant population has no doubt been affected by both Liberian and Ivorian refugees, the author gives no estimate as the 2002 MIKE survey is not yet available. In 2003 an estimate for Azagny NP elephants was about 65 animals. No elephants were seen during 2002 rennaissance flights  in either Haut Banana GR or in the Bossematie/Bek forest complex.  About 30 animals are  thought to be present in the Haut Sassandra FR. (Blanc et al., 2002:  Barnes, 2002: Fischer et al., 2002.: Ouattara, 2002 and 2003)	MRigby	pachy038.05.064.075.pdf
Noupa, Paul	Analyse biometrie des pointes d'elephants saisies dans le cadre de lutte antibraconnage par les services de la conservation dans le massif du Sud-est Cameroun	Pachyderm	2005	Research and Review	38	76	81	This article assesses data from tusks measured during a study focusing on biometric measurements taken on the carcasses of forest elephant poached in southeastern Cameroon.  Measurements from 62 tusks suggest that 2 out of 3 elephants poached in this region are young individuals. 'The average tusk weight of the poached elephants examined was 4.44 kg, against an average of 15 kg estimated for the area.  Data provides an indicator of the type of offtake in the area and its potential impact on the population as a whole. This analysis 'provides evidence that  sexual diamorphism becomes apparent in young elephants when the tusk length reaches 75 cm. The author notes that although the sample was small, the study provided an initial data set for detailed knowledge on the population structure of southeastern Cameroon's elephant populations, and  he hopes that professional hunting guides will take measurements to supplement it	MRigby	pachy038.05.076.081.pdf

Mubalama, Leonard Kakira; Mbula, Deo	Less room for a small population of elephants in severely encroached Mikeno massif, southern Virunga National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo	Pachyderm	2005	Field Notes	38	106	109	Although poaching seems to be the most urgent threat in Virunga NP,  any elephant conservation strategy needs to address expanding human activity and incursions into the park's Mikeno forest zone.  Antipoaching operations seized a  substantial number of weapons, dismantled several hundred snares, and led to the arrest of a few people. But the biodiversity of the Mikeno forest zone, which probably contains about 75 elephant (in an area which could sustain 120. Barnes. 1990), is at risk if hunting, deforestation, and uncontrolled livestock grazing and cultivation are not curbed in the immediate future.  Increasing human population land use needs in this area are compounded  by the fact that the park lies in a border region recently affected by civil wars. The authors recommend that DR Congo and Rwanda ratify the Lusaka Agreement Task Force, an action that would provide for assistance and coordination in law enforcement . They suggest the forest corridor at Mwaro, an 800 metre corridor used by both elephants and buffalo, which allows animals to move from the Mikeno section to other sections of the park  is vital in the maintenance of genetic diversity.

Barnes, Richard F. W.; Hema, Emmanuel M.; Nandjui, Awo; Manford, Mildred Appiah; Dubiure, Umaru-Farouk; Danquah, Emmanuel K. A.; Boafo, Yaw	Risk of crop raiding by elephants around the Kakum Conservation Area, Ghana	Pachyderm	2005	Research and Review	39	19	25	This Augsut 2000-September 2002 study monitored crop damage by elephants in the vicinity of Kakum CA. The Conservation Area, comprised of about 370 sq kms formerly known as  Kakum NP and Attandanso FR, has a population of about  220 elephant. The forest in the protected area is a fragment of the lowland forest  the once occupied much of southwestern Ghana.  (Adjewodah, et al. 2005: Barnes, et al. 2003) The CA  is almost completely surrounded by agricultural land under both subsistance and commerical cropping.  10 study sites of  one sq each were randomly chosen around the periphery of the CA.  A local villager was trained and hired to monitor and record elephant caused damage to crops. In 2001 a total of 213 fields were monitored. 55 of these fields suffered damage and a 120 incidents were recorded.  It was apparent that distance from the CA boundary, size of field, type and number of crops in the field of crop, and isolation of the field all played a role is whether of not the field was raided.  Maize and cassava were the most commonly raided crops and plantains were third. Smaller and more isolated fields close to the park were most often raided, however elephant also seemed to be attacted and larger farms with many crops in the fields.  Recommendations suggest 'a farmer could  drastically reduce risk by moving away from the park boundary,  joining other farmers in a cluster, limiting farm size and growing fewer kinds of crops.  This study was part of the training programme for officer interested elephant biology and management.	MRigby	pachy039.05.019.025.pdf
Karidozo, Malvern; Osborn, Ferrel V.	Can bees deter elephants from raiding crops? An experiment in the communal lands of Zimbabwe	Pachyderm	2005	Research and Review	39	26	32	This project in the Lower Guruve District in northern Zimbabwe sought to explore the hypothesis put forth by Vollrath nd Douglas-Hamilton. In Samburu/Laikipia area of Kenya  they  'observed that elephants did not feed on trees with hives and trees prone to elephant damage experienced no furhter damage'.  (Vollrath and Douglas-Hamilton. 2002) The earlier researchers suggested that besides the protection factor keeping bees could provide economic returns by harvesting the honey.  The Lower Guruve District is under going rapid agricultural expansion but still contains a high and mobile elephant population. To test the effectiveness of  bees in deterring elephants, hives were placed near entrances to maize, cotton and sorghum fields, along elephant paths to these fields and near paths to waterpoints in gardens. selected  maizeand sorghum plots were visited 5 times a week for 6 months, and wherever field visits were made the observer recorded any activity between any elephant present and the bees from  the nearby hives.  58 incidents of crop damage were recorded.  79% of the damage was done by bulls,  14% by cows and 7% by mixed herds.  59% of the damage was done to crops in their growing stage while 41% was done to crops in their mature stage.  Maize was the most often damaged crop.  This study found no significant difference between fields damaged with bees/hives  and without bees/hives.  However, it was noted that elephants avoided entrances to fields in plots near bee hives.  Elephants tended not to use paths to waterpoints when hives had been placed but made new paths to these waterpoints.  When hives were placed along paths in a forested area heavily used by elephants the elephants moved away from this area.  Although this study did not find bees were deterred from raiding crops the authors tend to support the hypothesis of the earlier study.	MRigby	pachy039.05.026.032.pdf

A map showing where the elephant carcasses werer found and the villages wherein poaching equipment was found links this activity to ethnic groups living in different areas in the vicinity. 183 elephants were known to have been illegally killed or poached between January 1993 and January 2004. The present population is estimated to be 214 +/-159. The animals were mostly poached for their ivory, the meat was generally consumed fairly quickly.  However, lately the carcasses are often simply left to rot. Firearms using  locally made bullets are often used. Both rifles and shotguns have been confiscated by the antipoaching programme.  Snares made of cable wire and pin-board traps which  pierce the elephants' footpads are common.  Notes that crop raiding is present and agriculturalists are antagonistic towards elephatns.  Antipoaching campaigns should assess this  aspect and make conflict mitigation part of any programme.	MRigby	pachy039.05.033.042.pdf
Lagendijk, D. D. Georgina; de Boer, Willem F.; van Wieren, S. E.	Can African elephants survive and thrive in monostands of Colophospermum mpane woodlands?	Pachyderm	2005	Research and Review	39	43	49	This literature review based paper focused on the food value/energy requirements of  Colophospermum mopane to elephants. Mopane is an important browse for elephant in southern Africa and is particularly heavily utilized during the dry season because it is 'one of the few food plants still carrying leaves during this bottleneck period'. Mopane leaves collected in May from Kruger NP and data from mopane in the Tuli area of Botswana during all season were used in the calculations for daily food intake and gross energy requirements. (Owen-Smith 1988: Styles and Skinner 1997, 2000)  Elephant spend 12-18 hours of the day foraging .  4% of their live weight is considered to be the daily browse intake. This study found that the animals required more mopane browse than 4% of their live weight and so in as long as they can browse for the length of time required to provide for the greater intake they could survive. Calculations suggest a mature bull browsing solely on mature green mopane would  need to browse for 14 hours in order to achieve energy requirements.  The nutritive quality of mopane is high throughout the year, this study suggests its energy content is sufficient for elephants year round if they utilize all parts (leaves, twigs, bark) and  given they have sufficient browse time to take in larger quanitities in times of lower nutrition value. Mopane are known to be high in tannins, and research is needed to understand the effects these and other secondary compounds have on intake,digestibility and metabolism.

This was done in part to check the precision of the counts and in part as a reviews the apparent situation in Zambia which suggests that unlike other southern Afican areas the elepahant population of Zambia is decreasing rather than increasing.  The estimated population was over 10000 in 1991 with about half in Kafue NP itself and the rest largely in Mumbwa and Sichifula GMAs, with about 2500, and in Mulobezi with about 1600 and a some in Lunga-Luswich. In a 1996 survey the total population was under 5000 the majority of animals were in Kafue NP with a small number in Mumbwa and Sichifula GMAs.  The 2004 survey noted elephant only in Kafue NP itself and the estimated total population was 1555 which was lower tht the 3798 estimation from the 2001 counts which also observed animals only in Kafue NP.

Ogola, Patrick O.; Omondi, Patrick O. M.	Demography of a confined elephant population and the potential consequence of translocation: the case of  Sweetwaters Game Reserve, Kenya	Pachyderm	2005	Research and Review	39	57	62	Between February and July 2001 the demography of  the elephant population in Sweetwaters GR  in the Laikipia District of Kenya was studied with particular reference to age structure, family group size and family unit composition.  Since 1989 this populations has been confined effectively confined by fences. Data in this study was compared with that from an earlier  1992-1993 study. (Omondi et al, 1993)  Observations largely confined to waterpoints and salt licks focused on identifying individuals and family units in order to assess the population prior to a planned translocation of bulls and family units to Meru NP. The 120 elephant observed includes 100 in 12 cow-calf groupings and 20 independent bulls ranging in age from 10 years of age upwards. The cow calf grouping accounted for 59% of the observations.  The structure of these groups included  9.6% calves of one year or younger and 49.6' females aged over 12 years. About 94% of the females  'were observed to associate closely with cales thought to be their offspring' which suggests that this population is increseing at a high rate. The number of groups has increased, but the average group size has decreased since the 1992-1993 study which suggests and population which feels secure of unthreatened. Shortly after this study  members of a number of family units  identified during the observations were moved as a groups and most of the independent bulls were removed from this population and translocated in Meru NP.  The study population indluded was 59 females, and 61 males: 23 of the females were calves and subadults, and 36 were mature cows while 54  of the males were calves and subadults and 7 were mature bulls. After identified groups and  bulls had been translocated the remaining g population consisted of  64 animals, 27 females and 37 males: 8 of the females were calves and subadults and 19 were mature cows, while of the 37 males 36 were calves or subadults and 1 was a mature bull. The population dynamics of the remaining population will be interesting to observe.	MRigby	pachy039.05.057.062.pdf

The author suggests 'ivory market in the Khartoum-Omdurman area of northrt sudan is one of the few in the world tht has expanded significantly since the mid-1990s'. He found the price craftsment paid for raw ivory had increased  'workhop owners and craftsmen pay USD 105/kg for a 2-5 kg tusk compared with USD 44/kg for a 5-10 kg tusk in 1997'. The number of craftsment has also increased during this same time period, about 150 craftsmen who carve both  ivory and work were identified compared to about 100 in 1997.  Jewellery and small figurines are the most common items made. The author noted 50 retail outlets who displayed over 11300 items made from tusks probably obtained from elephant poached since 1990. Accoding to Sudanese law this trade in new ivory is illegal ,and the author suggest that is 'threatening central African elephant populations'.  The items are cheap compared with prices in other countires and nearly all the buyers are foreigners working in Sudan.	MRigby	pachy039.05.067.076.pdf

This study suggets the UK and German markets are relatively significant but consider that thos of France, Italy and Spain are small.  Germany and France have legal active ivory craftsmen and ivory stockpiles for such use. Most of the items seen were ivory items imported prior to 1989, or were legal antique items imported since then.  Some East Asian and African worked items from later ivory were seen, but this illegal material is considered to be very minor. The author suggest the demand for tusks, legal otr illegal,  is small and the five surveyed countries 'seem to be complying well with CITES'.	MRigby	pachy039.05.077.090.pdf

Elephant death, possibly by constipation	Pachyderm	2005	Field Notes	39	93	96	This article reviews the observations and analysis concerning the death of a wild juvenile male elephant which apparently died from constipation, probably from eating sisal, a plant rarely eaten by elephant. When the young animal was first seen in the vicinity of a waterhole on Ndarakwai Ranch in Tanzania on Decmber 21 2004 the researchers noted its rather odd behaviour.  The juvenile was seen several times between that date and its death on Janury 3, 2005. Although at first it appeared to be part of a family unit the young male spent little time with other young elephants or specific adults.  What appeared to be a protuding bolus was evident on the first day of observation. The young male spent a significant amount of time rubbing on trees and soaking in the mud, but was rarely seen drinking, eating  or interacting with other its own age or younger. Examination of the carcass confirmed constipation probably caused by ingesting  sisal. The faeces contained  prickles and the undigested fibres of the sisal had formed long cables.

When it was initially presented at the EMOA symposium in 2004 vascetomy had not yet performed on a bull elephant, but since tht time the opertion has been carried out several times in South Africa. The article reviews the advantages of male sterilization over that of females and looks at the 'general, technical, sex-related and financial aspects of the vascetomy of elephant bulls'.  It appears that after dominant bulls are selected, treatment of less that 2% of the elephants would stabilize a population in parks with a natural population growth rate.  Analysis suggests that for parks with 100 to 300 elephants, occasional vasectomy of a dominant bull would provide an effective elepahnt family planning tool.	MRigby	pachy039.05.097.103.pdf

Hillman Smith, A. K. Kes; Ndey, Jerome Amube	Post-war effects on the rhinos and elephants of  Garamba National Park	Pachyderm	2005	Rhino Notes	39	106	110	During the first 8 years after the Garamba NP project began the elephants in that vicinity increased from an estimated population of 3300 in 1984 to an estimated population of 11175 in 1995.  The war is souther Sudan increasingly affected the area from 1991 onwards as both refugees and military groups came into the area.  By 1998 the estimated elephant population  5874. Systematic aerial counts taken in April prior to the beginning of the wet season  noted that by 2004 there were no elephant north of the Garamba River. The Apil 2004 elephant population in the southern part of the park was estimated to be  6354.  A rough count in November 2004 suggested abut 2000 elephant remained in the park area. A total aerial count in August 2005 counted 1202 elephant. Counts are planned for early 2006 and it is hoped that intertnational interest and assistance in a post war situation may serve to conserve and maintain an elephatn as well as a northern white rhino population.

Recensement d'éléphants dans la Réserve Communautaire du Lac Télé, République du Congo	Pachyderm	2006	Research and Review	41	20	28	"We surveyed elephants in the 4400-km2 Lac Télé Community Reserve in the Republic of Congo to provide estimates of population status and trends. Habitat in the reserve consists of seasonally flooded and swamp forest with patches of terra firma forest. Using line transects and distance sampling techniques we estimated elephant densities from dung counts in both low- and high-water seasons (flooding seasons). We estimated that the reserve holds low densities of elephants in seasonally flooded and swamp forest. Elephants are present in the terra firma forest in the high-water season only. Our estimate in 2004 of 316 (95% CI 98, 1045) elephants in the reserve is similar to that found in 2002. However, there was a large error in calculating estimates because of the low number of dung piles. Further surveys may help to reduce this error and provide information on elephant distribution between habitats."	MRigby	pachy041.06.020.028.pdf
